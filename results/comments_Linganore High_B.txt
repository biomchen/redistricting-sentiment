Thank you so much for not having Westwinds go to Oakdale in either option.  This made no sense me to
even be considered.  Thanks for correcting this in the new options.We stay in the same schoolNOStudents will still attend Linganore HS, shortest bus/drive.Doesn't effect usNothingno change for usNo opinionNaI don't like itThis one seems like it is splitting neighborhoods.Thank you for keeping West Winds going to the high school that is 2.5 miles from our house!!  It is our main
priority.I like that Option B sends all of Landsdale to Linganore but keeps the Penn Shop neighborhood all at
Urbana.This does not effect usWest Winds neighborhood will move on to Linganore, those kids get to move up with friends they've gone
to NMES and NMMS withKeeps current Twin Ridge students at the same high schoolLooking at the growth in our community, this is the ONLY option that makes sense for FCPS and our
community as a whole.  It will better balance the utilizations of our schools.N/A - stays the same for usKeeps child at LinganoreOption B does very little to relieve overcrowding at UHS.  I don't like it!!I like that PB146 retains NMMS / LHS. Shorter distances to schools for parents / teen drivers / buses and
safer routes.There is too much on the interactive map for me to clearly understand what will take place with my kids.
Parents need a less complicated version. I tried to search by my address but was unable to enter it.Does not change my child's high school.This option adds a few more kids closer to Linganore to the school.No changeLinganoreNo to Option B. If you are going to take kids out of NMES, pulling them away from New Market Community and lumping us with other Linganore villages, don't then put the kids back to NMMS for middle and Linganore HS, which equals crazy changing feeder patterns and having to change friends again and again. Hopefully, you will keep us at NMES, but if you go with option B for new elementary, at least then have us feed into Oakdale Middle and Oakdale. High School for a sensible feeder pattern. So feeder
would be New elementary --> Oakdale Middle-> Oakdale HS.I like this option as it allows my daughter to attend LHS w/her classmates, and it will be a shorter driving
distance once she gets her license and is driving to and from after-school activities.Staying with LinganoreMy schools don't changeLake Linganore, at least east of Boyers Mill Road, should probably have never been redistricted to Oakdale HS.  This would be a step in correcting that.  And even though it might be considered "splitting a community," West Winds already goes to Linganore, and quite honestly Lake Linganore is a community of communities anyway.  So at least you're taking one of those communities and putting it back where it
probably belongs anyway.I prefer HS Option B.  It limits the transportation costs.  Transporting those kids from the Kemptown area all
the way to Linganore is a waste!This seems to balance student location to their high school the best.  These students will be driving to school
and the closer the distance the better in regards to safety.does not affectWest Winds continues to go to LinganoreMakes sense geographically.Liganore HSLike that it is also LinganoreNo real opinionI like that it keeps west winds in linganorenanit keeps my children in the same middle schoolIt keeps WestWinds in the current feeder pattern with closest schoolsSee belowI favor this option so that LHS doesn't absorb more from the Urbana District.
