I like that the entire Spring Ridge community is being kept together for middle school.  However, I do not feel that GTJMS is the best option for Spring Ridge as there is a middle school (OMS) much closer.
Logistically, it makes more sense to send students to a school closer to their residence.Nothing.  Spring Ridge is closer to OMS than TJMS.   Other new construction that is closer to TJMS is going to OMS.  Our children will be separated from middle school friends to accommodate new construction that
should be pulled to TJMS, not us.Option B is the better option of the two presented to help with overcrowding at UMS & OMS.noneThe Spring Ridge neighborhood will go to GTJMS, which is a smaller school.Nothing, I think bussing all of the kids from Spring Ridge 45 minutes to TJ middle is ridiculous when there
is a school 7 minutes awayI agreeSee above. Nothing.  Option a and B are not different for our schools at allDo not likenothing,nothingNothingNothingThe whole neighborhood going to the same middle school  and keeps us part of the Lou community that the
children have always been apart of.DislikeNothingYesNothing wanted OakdaleIt keeps our neighborhood together.It keeps our neighborhood together.Not a lotNothingNothing.  We don't feel that it makes sense for our planning block (1) to attend TJ Middle while other planning blocks (62, 100, 74) which are closer to TJ Middle attend Oakdale Middle.  We live 5 minutes from
Oakdale Middle and 15 minutes from TJ Middle.It does not make sense for our planning block to attend TJ Middle while other planning blocks which are
closer to TJ Middle attend Oakdale Middle.  We live much closer to Oakdale Middle than TJ Middle.I don't like it. TJMS is too far from SR and doesn't give SR a good feeder pattern.  See comments above.It keeps future enrollment down at OHS.
