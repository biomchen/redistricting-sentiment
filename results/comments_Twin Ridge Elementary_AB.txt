Option A helps my child from NOT riding a school bus for 45-60 minutes to travel 18 miles!NoNoneNoI prefer option B for ES b/c it keeps the class sizes a bit smaller at TRESBoth options add more kids to Twin Ridge, which I am not a fan of. The school is a good size now as it is.
Why not use 70 as the dividing line and send the kids on the other side of 70 to Green Valley?Both are good but have odd divides at the south end. Some kids who live directly next to each other would
go to different schools.Find a contractor who can deliver an option with no split feeder patterns. I have not seen one option that doesn't have a split feeder pattern. FCPS needs to consider the mental health of these children when already
having stresses of moving to middle school.Kemptown is not over capacity and every parent I speak to there says they do not want any change.  Leave
Kemptown's boundaries alone!Splitting children from their friends caused a unnecessary stresses in a already stressful time moving from
elementary to middle schoolThe increase in the TRES District is too drastic.
