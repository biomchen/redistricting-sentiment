Same answerNothingDo not prefer itAI don't like itDislikeNothingNothingCenterville is less likely to need portable classrooms.I do not like itThe community's suggestion is being incorporated in Option B, we vote for this optionElementary options will not be affecting my son,  I do not have an opinion other than i like that all current
urbana students will remain in urbana schools.NeutralNothingThe Urbana students will be going to schools whithin the community and there appears to be less students
in these schools under option B.Not a fan.no opinion -have no kids in elementaryOption B is what the community have suggested and what we wanted!more "integration" of Villages of Urbana with outside neighborhoods. Sometimes very insular communities
aren't the best thing.I loved to see the very much needed relief to the Centerville ES, besides I like how you draw the ES
boundaries for the schools in the Urbana area. This is perfect, and nothing need to be change.I like it keeps the elementary and high schools the same.End up at Urbana High.Option B have the long term vision for FCPS long term development. I also like how boundaries being draw
that traffic flow inside the community is optimizedTrying to keep as many kids that live close to that school at that school.  Not reaching far away across the
neighborhood to bring other students to that school.Maximize walkers and keeps community togethernanDoesn't matter for usBetter utilization.There are less students from Urbana ES being feed to Windsor Knolls MSThe only positive thing I see in Option B is a better utilization of resources.
