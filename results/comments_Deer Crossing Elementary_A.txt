There is a small attendance area, keeping class sizes small.I like being moved to East County ES because I am not happy with admin at our current school.It keeps us in our most local elementary school with our closest neighbors.nanNo opinion.I don't care, my kids are done with elementary school this year.Keeps LL togethernanKeeps me in my current district.Yes!!It's fineI am eager to have my kids attend the new elementary schoolnanKeeps the neighborhood with their childhood friends.Fewest # impactedIt keeps the Eaglehead at Linganore boundaries intact.Our village will be kept with the rest of the community. My daughter will attend Oakdale high as expected
when we purchased our home.New elementary school to lessen the burden on deer crossingI think that Option A is best because you are still leaving the smallest foot print as the Westwinds
community is not impacted.The villages of Lake Linganore are together through middle and high school as they are now. It seems unfair to cut off one village from the rest. Like Woodridgge was disappointed, with the first round, it is disappointing to see that now the Meadow and Balmoral are split. This confuses me since Pinehurst and Summerfield are closer to NMMS. I would love to see villages stay together and at the closest location. if
things gave to be divided, it makes more sense to me to divide the new houses not the established.EverythingMeadows/Balmoral do not get split from the rest of the LL community besides WW who is currently splitMy kids will continue to attend DCES. We moved to our current home do they would attend DCES.All of Lake Linganore remains togetherYES!!Like itElementary schools will not be over crowdedlooks greatKeeps the LL community togetherKeeps our kids together who have grown up together.i like keeping all the neighborhood kids together!It keeps Linganore as a community together which is the whole reason we moved here.All of Lake Linganore remains togetherKeep community togetherKeeping our community kids together as the continue to grow and through their lifeline educational
experience.Close to the communityWe are still at the same schoolsI am not personally affected by the elementary school. It is exciting to go to the new school and have
updated technology and establishing a new culture. It seems like the draw area is smaller than in option B.The Meadows is one of several LLA neighborhoods moving to the East County ESIt keeps most of LL in the same schoolAcceptThat our current situation won't change and friends/neighbors will not be separated.It keeps all of Lake Linganore together. We are a very close knit community.it doesn't separate neighborhood kids from each other and makes the most senseThat my son will stay in the school district currently assigned with all his friends.nanIt keeps all of the existing kids in the same schools.Glad to be at new schoolnanKids would go to Deercrossing.My kids continue to go to school with their neighborhood piersAcceptThat most of Lake Linganore villages stay together.My children would go to the new east elementary school and there would be less crowing at deer crossing.
It also keeps our neighborhoods together and in district path for Oakdale schools.Keeps the community togetherKeeps LLA community together.I have no problem with itKeeping the community together and not uprooting my daughter late in her schooling to a new school
when she has established activities at her current school.N/A - by the time the school is built, I won't have an elementary school aged childNothingIt keeps us in the Oakdale DistrictKeeps our kids togetherKeeps all of Linganore neighborhoods togetherRetains Deer Crossing ESOption A allows for WestWinds to not split their neighborhood into 2 elementary schools.nanIt will keep my daughter in her current school and with her current group a children that she's been in
school with since K.This doesn't effect my family. Both options have it redistricted from current.I understand the need for some areas to fill the new elementary school. I hope that the school will consider
opening with grades K-4 and keep 5th graders in their home school for that last year.keeps neighborhood kids togetherKeeping the neighborhood kids together.  Strongly want this optionIt doesn't divide the neighborhood and break up the sense of community that we've developed.My understanding is that Option A is the same as Option B for my child.  I assume her last 2 years will be at
the new East County School.smaller area for new East County ESMakes senseRedistricting doesn't affect our ES child, but the areas seem to make senseThere is no difference between Option A and B for Elementary School.that it keeps all of lake linganore togetherWill keep LLA community children in the same schools as their neighborhood friends! Better sense of
community. Please don't split these kids up.NaLake Linganore stays together for middle and HSFor us A& B are the same.It will relieve Deer CrossingWhile it would be nice to have our community stay the same, this option has the least amount of impact and seems to be split effectively. It makes sense for the North side of LL to go to the New Elementary because of
proximity.It is important to me that all of Lake Linganore residents stay together as much as possible.It is by far the best option for my family and my immediate area.Community stays together.support - keeps with LLA communitynanI like that overcrowding at Deer Crossing is addressed and the division between Lake Linganore
neighborhoods is fairly equal.Lake Linganore neighborhood stays togetherDraft A keeps our neighborhood more intact and distinguishes a solid feeder pattern.Keeps children in the grades together from the neighborhood.  Does not adversely affect children by
changing their schools on them.It prevents splitting the new East County School at the middle school level; splitting schools was a concern
for parents during the March presentations and I thought it was to be avoided. We live in PB 154.Both options have us as the same school.Includes all of MeadowsLeast disruptive for incumbent children.-All of Lake Linganore stays together at the same schoolIt doesn't change the school we attend at all, so seems fine to me.Keeps us at Deer CrossingUnsureUnsure-I like that option A splits lake linganore evenly between deer crossing elementary and the new east county
elementary school. Except for west winds, who would like to stay at new market elementary.nanThat the community stays togetherI would have preferred our community to stay at DCES.The attempt to keep larger sections of the neighborhoods more together.nanThe Meadows should be kept with the rest of Lake Linganore. Our kids have made close bonds with all of
Lake Linganore and not just the meadow.nan-I like the Elementary School Draft Option A because it affects the least amount of children. Our school Deer Crossing gets split into 2 schools the new east county elementary and Deer Crossing. We would belong the new East county elementary school in both options but here we basically split lake linganore into 2 schools and leaving some room into the new school for growth from development. let's just add that these kids at elementary level are going to be split from their friends no matter what but since the split is almost even it
will be less traumatic and they will still see faces they know at the new school.Option A reduces the amount of time the students spend traveling on a bus, increasing family &
recreational time. Smaller class sizes.With respect to the impact to the Lake Linganore Community, I like Elementary School Options A and B.It keeps the neighborhood that I currently live in (lake linganore meadows) in the new east county school
districtIt keeps all of the Lake Linganore community in the same school district.Its closer location to our neighborhoodNothing, it splits our neighborhood and our kids will lose their friends at a significant time in their lives and
have to start over.Keeps kids togetherI prefer this option in that it keeps the Lake Linganore community together in the same school.  The new development should be left out in that one, it is new and the relationships will be new anyway and two, it gives the home buyers clarity as to what schools their children will be attending at the time of purchase or
construction.A and B place us at the same school.Does not affect meNoKeeps the same kids from Oakdale MS to Oakdale HSIt keeps my family in our home school.Keep Lake Linganore togetherIt keeps most of Lake Linganore together in two schools (Blue Heron and Deer Crossing)  Only Westwinds
is separated in New Market.I like that the Lake Linganore community stays together (minus West Winds which is already separate).I like it because it keeps my community together and impact the least number of children. it also has a more
balanced enrollment utilization at all levels.It keeps Oakdale middle and highMy son will be going to the new elementary school in either proposal so I don't have a preference either
way.don'tBoth option A and B have my children attending the new East County  Elementary School which is closer to
our house and our community, this great for my children to remain connected with children in close to usIt alleviates crowding at DCES by moving some students to the new BHESNo opinionCommunity unityBoth Elementary drafts look fineBalmoral and the Meadows (PB154, 157, and 159) have an average of 100 students at each school level. That is a very small amount of students to move from the greater Lake Linganore community. Lake Linganore is  a well connected community both physically and socially through trails that connect our neighborhood and community events. We feel that the small amount of students pulled into the LHS feeder would isolate these
students socially from the greater community.It will alleviate the current overcrowding of Deer Crossing Elementary.Preserves feeder patternI like there are fewer students impacted by Option A.That it keeps all of Lake Linganore together as they are now. My neighborhood and balmoral would stay with their classmates and continue to thrive. There are not enough students in these 2 neighborhoods to even make a difference in the school population. The new hamptons east and west isn't even built yet and thus would not affect anyone    they would know what they are moving into. Option A needs to stay and
keep the current kids together, I still can't fathom why these 2 small enclaves would be considered to be
separated.All of the communities that border the lake and summer field stay together in Lake LinganoreBoth options put us in new Elementary school so I an indifferentNoneit is consistent with the current boundaries-I like how Blue Heron ES students will stay together throughout middle school and high school.NothingIt keeps the Lake Linganore community togetherI like that Option A because it unites our community with West Winds and the new community while relieving the overcrowding at Deer Crossing, and accomplishes a better feeder pattern, it also accomplishes
more long term consistency to our community which seems to fall in a pattern of continual redistricting.I like that it keeps the villages of Meadows and Balmoral in the Oakdale High School feeder pattern and
keeps the Westwinds village where they want to be.I don't like that it breaks up our communitySeems like smaller population for the new school, which is where I believe my son will be going.We like both options for elementary schoolReducing the overcrowding in DCES while still preserving existing feeder patterns.The allocation of neighborhoods/students among the new East County elementary and Deer Crossing is
appropriate.I like that Draft Option A allows PB 146 to remain in NMES, which is their current assignment. It also keeps
the proximity of the schools and the homes closer, which is a very important issue to me.I like that it keeps the Meadows and Balmoral in the OHS feederIt is fineThat my son stays with his friends going to Oakdale HSdoesn't include nw area
