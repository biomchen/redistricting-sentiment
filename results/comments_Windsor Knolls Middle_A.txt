This is suitable adn will not overcrowd Windsor Knolls via Landsdale.No opinion. Same as before.Windsor Knolls makes the most sense for our neighborhood based on proximity.nanNo opinionno opinioncontinue to NOT support this option due to KES families being switched to UESno changeWindsor Knolls makes sense, walking distanceThese options are the same for us either way, and I am fine with that.proximityIt minimizes bus travel for Middle School students that go to Windsor Knolls Middle School.Option A keeps him at the same Middle SchoolOur Middle School Changes!not applicable to my middle schoolerUpset twin ridge won't go to new market middleIt would be nice to have my child attend a school closer, so less bus time and a lot more  friends go to New
Market.I don't prefer itWindsor Knolls MS have an imbalance feeder pattern and not acceptableMy kids will still be just down the roadDoes not overcrowd Windsor KnollsI like that most of the kids north of 70 in Mt Airy will go to NMMS instead of WKMSit reduces the WK overcrowdingIt is fine.Reduces Windsor knolls class sizes for a longer time. Under capacity for longer timeIt is fine as it maintains the MS for which we are currently zoned.My son will see his SS friends again.NothingMS remains Windsor Knolls for our communityNo opinion.This will change us from Windsor Knolls to New Market.  New Market is significantly closer to our home.It is unfair and abusiveFineThe options have no impact on us.I think option A minimizes the number of kids that will be at Windsor Knolls Middle School (if I am looking
at this correctly).Not affected.My kids would go to NMMS instead of WKMS. We live near taylorsville. WKMS is way too far away.No opinion as neither A/B change the feeders for my area.WKMSI like that some of the Twin Ridge ES community gets moved to a closer, under capacity school like New
Market MiddleNothing is changing so not sure what to say about thisNot impactedN/aSame it's fineThat my kids would have a shorter bus ride going to New Market Middle (which is closer to our house)No opinion.It doesn't affect us, but the kids from the far north side of the feeder seem to be driving A LONG WAYS to
get to windsor knolls middle.They do not impact us, but I'm happy for the families that they will help, Geographically.I'm neutral about the middle school optionsIt keeps us at same middle school that we are currently zoned forno opinionnanI like that the utilization is lowest for Windsor Knolls MS and the greater number of students from Urbana
ES will go to Windsor Knolls MSStays the same - GoodNo opinionNot much.Good schoolGood schoolKeeps Lansdale neighborhood together and at closest schoolnanStudents in north part of Winsdor Knolls MS assigned to New Market MS, which is closer with a net

It splits Twin Ridge kids, who are already on the outskirts of the county, between WK and NMMS.    The option for our students to ALL go to NMMS, which makes most sense distance-wise, was
dropped.   I HOPE this was not to cater to a few vocal parents in another district....Students in north part of Winsdor Knolls MS assigned to New Market MS, which is closer with a net

decrease on 2 school buses.Nothing.No opinionFewer students impactedOption A most closely fits the current boundary.No opinionNothing to like -- splitting any school in the feeder program is not a good option.  This is an attempt to
correct the routing of TRES students to WKMS --  All of TRES should be feeding into NMMS.nannanIt doesn't change for usN/a no change from where we stand nowStudents in north part of Winsdor Knolls MS assigned to New Market MS, which is closer with a
net decrease on 2 school busses.Doesn't change for usNo opinionI like that it keeps the entire current Kemptown community attending WKMSnanSee aboveThis option has no impact on me.With a child with a severe allergy, I won't be able to get to her in an emergency. It makes no sense to send kids to a middle school 30 minutes away when there is one 10 minutes away. It's also safer for the kids to be
transported by bus to a close school rather than one further away.is more geographically compactNo opinionOverall, it is good. I like the fact that it impacted less students.No opinionKeeps current Kemptown students moving to WKMS togetherKids will be attending middle schools close to them.Going to New Market MS which is so much closer.Either option is favorableokI don't like either plan.  Twin Ridge students north of I-70 should be routed to New Market.It is same as before and so no commentsno commentsI prefer MS Option A.  Even though I don't like the idea of splitting up Twin Ridge students when they go to middle school, I don't think FCPS is properly accounting for just how many students will be at Windsor Knolls Middle School in the years to come.  Landsdale is growing so fast and option B for MS puts too many additional students at Windsor Knolls when combined with other growth at places like Landsdale, say in 8
or more years.  FCPS is not looking far enough into the future!I like option A because my kids will stay with a larger group of kids from elementary.  Option B, they
would go to middle with kids from other elementries.Does not affectThe fact that UMS is not longer split is an advantage, although it does not provide relief to UMS it does meet the needs of that community.  Further, moving those students in the northern most area to New Market would allow those students to form friendships with students they will attend HS with earlier and
that is a positive.No change for meWe go to Windsor knollsNo opinionwon't have middle school agesNew market middleStudents in north part of Winsdor Knolls MS assigned to New Market MS, which is closer with a net

based on our home addressGoodNothing, it has my child switching middle schools in the middle of his MS CareerKeeps things as is for MSnanThis option keeps us at our current middle school.No opinionI have no major concerns about this option.I like that the students from PB 29 and 167 are mapped to the MS in their neighborhood along with the other
students in their neighborhood.Windsor Knolls MS attendance area makes sense with the upper portion of the current area moving out of
the boundary area, transportation-wise and facility-wise.Lower enrollment projection for Windsor KnollsNo opinionOption A is my preferred choiceMy child will go to WKMSI favor this option so WKMS doesn't over-extend into Oakdale and Urbana.No opinion
