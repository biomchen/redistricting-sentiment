Nothing.  My daughter is at Oakdale and would have to change schools for 5th grade and again for 6th
grade.the students stay in the same middle and high schoolIt keeps more kids walking to Centerville than Option B, though less than currently can walk. And it doesn't
carve out an established neighborhood (Westwinds) from their current school.Frankly, I don't like A or B because they redistrict my location to SRESOakdale doesn't seem to be impacted too much, so we like that.NothingI like that it keeps PB63 in Oakdale ES, MS and HS. This is the current alignment which makes most sense as
we are the closes established neighborhood to all three schools.this option disrupts the least amount of studentsThe Spring Ridge neighborhood will stay together and the school is right in our development.Keeps our youngest with existing friends and school communitynanI guess it's fine that all of the kids from Spring Ridge will now go to the same schoolThat PB #63 remains in the Oakdale feederHow kids stay at the same schoolKeeps us at Oakdale highThat it keeps the same feeder schoolsNo change between current and option A. Also, option B is very similar to A.I like that all of Spring Ridge attends togethernothingAll Spring Ridge togetherNothingDoes not affect meDislike - you will switch my child who attends Oakdale ES to Spring Ridge ESnice to have spring ridge together and have attendance at SRES not over capacityNoneZeroNothingnothing, what happened to option 3?  We were Oakdale and now we are SRI like that my kids will stay at schools that are closest to our house. And that they will stay within same
feeder pattern.Keeps our neighborhood togetherIt keeps neighborhoods together and my neighborhood won't be redistricted. My neighborhood stays in the
current feeder pattern.keeping neighborhoods togetherSchools stay the sameThat we are staying in Oakdale feederI do not see any different in option a and b for oakdale elementary school.My children would maintain consistency in the Oakdale feeder pattern.Spring Ridge is the designated school for SR residents.I like that our neighborhood kids in Greenview will go to Oakdale for elementary.Keeps Spring Ridge together and lowers the attendance rate by moving the pyramid program.A and B are the same for us given our planning block (1).   Because of our planning block (1) we have absolutely no options to choose from.  While we currently attend Oakdale ES and love it, we think it make
sense to keep the Spring Ridge community attending the same elementary school.A and B are the same for us.   It makes sense to keep the Spring Ridge community attending the same
elementary school.It keeps Spring Ridge together
