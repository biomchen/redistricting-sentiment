I like that the entire Spring Ridge community is being kept together for middle school.  However, I do not feel that GTJMS is the best option for Spring Ridge as there is a middle school (OMS) much closer.
Logistically, it makes more sense to send students to a school closer to their residence.Nothing.  Spring Ridge is closer to OMS than TJMS.   Other new construction that is closer to TJMS is going to OMS.  Our children will be separated from middle school friends to accommodate new construction that
should be pulled to TJMS, not us.I don't think Option A does enough to alleviate overcrowding at UMS & OMS, especially as it' appears to be
pulling kids from NMMS into OMS.I do not like it because it is not the closest school to my neighborhood. Families that live closer to the TJMS on the south side of 144 are bused past my home to OMS while my kids are bused the opposite way past their neighborhood (tulip hill and those adjacent) to TJMS, this seems inefficient and more costly with
bussesThe Spring Ridge neighborhood will go to GTJMS, which is a smaller school.Nothing, I think bussing all of the kids from Spring Ridge 45 minutes to TJ middle is ridiculous when there
is a school 7 minutes awayI agree with itNothing.  You are sending our kids across town and other houses that have not been built yet are being sent
to the middle school that is 3 miles from our house .Do not likenothing,nothingNothingNothingDislikeNothingNonothing.  want OakdaleIt keeps our neighborhood togetherIt keeps our neighborhood together.That all of Lake Linganore would go to OMS and not be split to NMMS.  Also that NMMS and WKMS have
a more compact feeder area.NothingNothing.  We don't feel that it makes sense for our planning block (1) to attend TJ Middle while other planning blocks (62, 100, 74) which are closer to TJ Middle attend Oakdale Middle.  We live 5 minutes from
Oakdale Middle and 15 minutes from TJ Middle.It does not make sense for our planning block to attend TJ Middle while other planning blocks which are
closer to TJ Middle attend Oakdale Middle.  We live much closer to Oakdale Middle than TJ Middle.I don't like it. TJMS is too far from SR and doesn't give SR a good feeder pattern.   Children will spend a substantial amount of time on the bus commuting into a high traffic area - not good for many reasons. Oakdale MS is significantly closer by a factor of two.
The study is flawed because the entire TJMS district is not being considered in the study.
