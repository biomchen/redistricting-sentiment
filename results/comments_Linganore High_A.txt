Thank you so much for not having Westwinds go to Oakdale in either option.  This made no sense me to
even be considered.  Thanks for correcting this in the new options.We stay in the same school.NOStudents will still attend Linganore HS, shortest bus/drive.Our High School remainsNo changeNo opinionWest winds should stay at NMHSMaintains feedersWest Winds should go to Linganore HSI like this one.  This doesn't affect my child.  I like how it's not breaking up neighborhoods.Thank you for keeping West Winds going to the high school that is 2.5 miles from our house!!  It is our main
priority.I like Option A because it mostly keeps OHS intact and  sends 2 LARGE neighborhoods to Linganore.This does not effect usWest Winds neighborhood will move on to Linganore, those kids get to move up with friends they've gone
to NMES and NMMS withLess disruption to Oakdale HSKeeps current Twin Ridge students at the same high schoolNOTHING!  This option only makes since if you have personal short term investments.  This option does
not help us county wide and we will be having the same issue but worse in the next 5 years.N/A - stays the same for us.Keeps child at LinganoreI like that more kids are being pulled from the UHS and going to LHS.  The kids closer to Mt. Airy should
be going to LHS.I like that PB146 retains NMMS / LHS. Shorter distances to schools for parents / teen drivers / buses and
safer routes.There is too much on the interactive map for me to clearly understand what will take place with my kids.
Parents need a less complicated version. I tried to search by my address but was unable to enter it.Does not change my child's high school.Option A keeps the most kids together from middle school.This is no changeGoing to LinganoreLove it as long as keep elementary school Option A. Keeps current feeder pattern of NMES--> NMMS-->
Linganore HS for PB 146.I like this option as it allows my daughter to attend LHS w/her classmates, and it will be a shorter driving
distance once she gets her license and is driving to and from after-school activities.Staying with LinganoreMy schools don't changeGets the rest of the Mt. Airy zip code (at least the Frederick County portion) to Linganore HSKeeps West Winds with New Market Middle -- No additional redistrictingThis is the closest to current district lines.Does not affectWest Winds continues to go to LinganoreDon't like this option.Liganore HSLike Linganore so that my child will be with children from the same feeder GVES, WKMS and LHSNo real opinionI like that it keeps west winds in linganoredistance to home address is closest to school; keeps it the same as current planThis option keeps us at our current high school.It keeps WestWinds in the current feeder pattern with closest schoolsSee belowI do not like that this option where LHS absorbs a larger area from the Urbana District.
