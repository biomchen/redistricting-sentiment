It's fine.Nothing-  I am unhappy with the safety at Green Valley Elementary and the county continues to avoid discussing the issue.   The school is old and lacks infrastructure for continued development.  The number of children going there is going to continue to grow and there is no plan to fix anything there.  The community was told it is not on the county's ten  year plan.  In ten years there are parts of that school that are going to fall apart- the bathrooms, the front doors.  I have grave concerns regarding the entrance to the school and  the windows in all the classrooms.  Without walls, kids are sitting ducks.   We were also told that the community and safe and tell people if we have concerns.  So we are supposed to police ourselves and identify any trouble.   By the time something happens, it will be too late.  The county was given money to fix security at school and because GVES will be the hardest to fix, they put it last.  That is sad.  I fine it very troubling that so many young kids will be there next year and there is no plan to fix any security issues
there.Same place as we are already- very close to neighborhoodGreen Valley does make the most sense for our neighborhood based on proximity. However, I do believe it needs some renovations. We may also have to consider if that school will be able to hold the number of
children that will be sent there from the Landsdale community in the coming years.nanKeeps us in the same elementary schoolNo opinionNo changeproximity, no change to current schoolnot applicable to my middle schoolerI oppose option AIt seems to keep Green Valley at a smaller overcrowded capacity.I like that GVES and Centerville will have less kids and draw from a smaller areanot muchNothing.

This is not a feasible option that helps or prepares to relieve future overcrowding at Green Valley
ES .Im good with that optionNothingnanFine with the optionI like the location of option AacceptableI'm not sure which option is whatClose to neighborhoodI'm happy that it is Green Valley ElemNot happyNothing.  Green Valley is an unsat school.nanThis option keeps my children at Green Valley Elementary. The second option isolates part of our neighborhood and sends them to Twin Ridge. Since we are districted to Windsor Knolls for middle school, I
think it makes sense to keep the kids at a Windsor Knolls feeder elementary school.No answer
