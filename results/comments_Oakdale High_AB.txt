I am extremely pleased with both Option A and B on all levels - elementary, middle, and high school.  I am happy that the public
has been kept well-informed throughout this process and that their feedback has been valued and considered.The meadows should not be split down the middle as far as school districts go. We prefer option A.I do not think option B is feasibly possible.  It will divide a few streets in the community to a different middle school making carpools, community and school spirit difficult and produces bus issues.  Option A allows the entire community to stay together and seems the more prudent and feasible option.  Option B has too many issues and complications arising from only a few
streets in the neighborhood to be redistricted.Please reconsider having the Meadows/ Balmoral neighborhoods separated from their communities.We may consider moving if our area of the Meadows is redistricted to Linganore High School. The school has a much lower rating than Oakdale. I don't like the idea of the Meadows being split into two different schools. This will be tough on all of the
neighborhood kids.I'm fine with either option. They are all good schools.It is ridiculous to separate ONLY the Meadows area students from ALL the other LL students!!Great optionsA is better than BI think option B is the better option - for the high school ratiosOption B please! Can't vote for it enough!!!While West Winds is already part of the Linganore feeder, adding the Meadows and Balmoral to that mix is not as seamless as it looks on a map.  The entrance to the Meadows is shared with Coldstream, Audobon, Northshore, etc.. on Boyers Mill which is no where near West Winds.  I understand teh new Hampton development being grouped with West Winds as their main entrance will be on Gas House Pike but I feel the Meadows and Balmoral need to stay on the Oakdale side.  (To be clear, I have no problems with either school, Linganore or Oakdale, they're both great!  I'm judging this based on logistics and a community
together in spirit.  Also if Eaglehead move to become a municipality in the future, which is being studied and discussed,  it seems that keeping the students in that municipality in the schools in that municipality should be a priority.)I am so disappointed that it is even an option to split our village of lake Linganore from the rest of the community for middle
and high school. We would have not purchased our home had we known this would happen. Or is completely unacceptable.This option helps keep kids in the Linganore community together in the most consistent way possible.  By allowing Meadows/Balmoral to stay in the same Oakdale pattern you are giving us the chance to maintain both student relationships AND parent relationships.  I rely heavily on the other parents for updates, information, and general details about if my kid is okay.  Even the walking trails in the Balmoral and Meadows areas connect with the rest of the community.  These relationships make our schools strong and our students perform better (which honestly, is great for the county).  It will be a detriment for the neighborhood and the school district if that advantage is taken away.  (I do not live in Balmoral/Meadows, I live in Pinehurst and this is still really important to me.  I like knowing the kids I see at the pool and at the park - I would hate to not have that
anymore).Please consider keeping our community together at the Oakdale feeders.What are the chances of Option C - Build a new high school, in the next 5-10 years?I think it's important that Meadows/Balmoral not be split from the rest of the community and not be split in half.  Friendships
and a sense of belonging/unity would be negatively impacted.Please keep the Lake Linganore Community together in the same high school and feeders.  It's a detriment to the kids that have  to change midway through the schooling and could have adverse affects on the neighborhoods eliminated for the Oakdale feeder
system.Keep option A and not B you will split a community!!!!Prefer Option A. More of our community stays together with this option. West Winds is closer to Linganore High and
Meadows/Balmoral closer to Oakdale High, so doesn't make sense to change this taking into consideration teen drivers.Dislike B because it splits lake Linganore.  The splitting was rejected by residents in round one. Unsure why it's even an option
for round 2.AI would like to see Options A and B combined as this would better help with crowding at both OHS & UHS.In Draft B - meadows neighborhood has No direct route to Linganore high school... breaks up the neighborhood ... only
neighborhood to have direct access to Gas House Pike is WoodridgeOption B takes a small chunk of our community and sends them to a different schoolI prefer that most Linganore communities stay together!  I think splitting Meadows & Balmoral from the rest (Coldstream, Aspens, Woodbridge, etc) Is NOT in the best interest of kids who have been going to school together for so long :(.  I vote for
DRAFT A!!!Please keep the Lake Linganore Community together in the same high school and feeders.  It's a detriment to the kids that have
to change midway through the schooling and could have adverse affects on the neighborhoods eliminated for the Oakdale feeder system.NoThis is happening because you caved to people in holly hills and Urbana.  If we wanted to go to tj or another school we would
have moved to a neighborhood that feeds to that school.Spilts our neighborhood upIn Option B, would it be possible to keep the existing houses/area from the Meadows/Balmoral in Lake Linganore at Oakdale and all the new building around the new elementary school would be the cut off to Linganore High? Obviously, there are not
current occupants living in that area and home owners would buy with the understanding of the boundary lines.We moved here with the knowledge that our child would attend Oakdale schools, and we want our child to attend with the
other students in our chosen communityPrefer aProximity to school and community cohesiveness are most important to us.  Option B takes away both for the Lake Linganore
community. We are closer to Oakdale so switching to Linganore will mean a much longer us ride for my kids.  It will also create a divide in the community.  I strongly disagree with option B.What will be beat for class sizes?I am more concerned and hoping that there is a way to grandfather kids in as the transition occurs. Of course we prefer to remain in the OHS district. I know there are areas within LLA with new developments. Most of us from the Meadows and Balmoral  have been part of the LLA community for many years. As a result, these kids have roots in the community and friends. It will be difficult to separate and start over as a high school student if there is not an option to grandfather in the kids 5th, 8th, 10th grade or higher (especially seniors and even juniors).  If parents select to drive these students to their current school, would that
potentially save transportation cost the first two years of the redistricting?Yes. PLAN A IS THE BEST PLAN FOR LAKE LINGANORE. THEY SHOULD ALL GO TO OAKDALE TOGETHER LIKE A
COMMUNITY SHOULD.Stop overdeveloping!It is breaking up the community.  Lake Linganore residents need to all go to the same schoolUprooting my daughter her junior year of high school would have a negative impact on the friends she has made in our community since kindergarten.   I am 100% against Option B.  It is disheartening to hear the redistricting could affect my child
who is in her last two years if school.In Option B you divide the Lake Linganore community, sending a small portion  (the Meadows and Balmoral) to a different middle and high school than the rest of the community. I think it is unfair to separate such a small group from their peers. These kids have grown up sharing the same pools, beaches, sports teams and boy/girl scout groups. My daughter will graduate from Oakdale Middle School when this goes into effect and then have to go to Linganore High School. This is a lot of burden on a few
students to leave 90% of their peers to go to a different high school. You mentioned that you would divide schools as close to 50/50 as you could.NoI prefer Option A because it does not break off one of the longest existing villages from the Lake Linganore Community.  As a Meadows resident for 19 years, my children have grown up with and formed relationships with other children in the Lake Linganore community including Pinehurst, Aspen, and Coldstream.  The uptick of growth and additions to Lake Linganore and surrounding communities makes Meadows residents feel like we are being "pushed out" , especially with this surprise Option B. Why can't the "new growth" /"new builds"  such as Hamptons East and West  take the impact of being redistricted to LHS since
the boundaries could be set and established before the houses are built?Again, Option B is a non-starter.  It removes the Meadows and Balmoral kids from any schooltime social interaction with literally
every other village in Lake Linganore.Why do you insist on splitting the two villages in Lake Linganore community from the others?noKeep our kids at OHS where they belongOption A: Would like to see our kids continue in the same schools as their friends that they play sports with, spend summers
with and build relationships with.I do not like Option B because it excludes a small portion of Lake Linganore from the Meadows.  These children have grown up
together in a close knit community and it is important to my family that the lake community sticks together.Draft Option A is well received by the majority of LLA Residents as it includes all villages retaining the same schools as we
currently haveIt is logical to feed future developments Hamptons West and East into New Market Middle and Linganore HS pattern. Construction is beginning and putting new developments into the LHS feeder will not cause community disruption like taking
established neighborhoods out of their current feeder. Option B will disrupt community ties in Lake Linganore.It makes no sense why you've heard how impt it is to keep the LL community together and didn't include one tiny section of the
Meadows/BalmoralWe are a community that is focused in our children and what is best for them. Many, if not all of us, have moved here and put
down roots with these current feeder schools in mind.I am for option A, opposed to option B.  I am a teacher in the LHS feeder pattern and know how good of a feeder pattern it is. However, I feel option B has significant issues with moving a contingent of the community to an entirely different system.  I do see the effects of option B with those living within the LHS/UHS feeder pattern, but those changes seem much more feasible as these students already have connections to LHS/UHS with their feeder systems currently merged.  Is seems a far more prudent decision to keep all of our community together as option A presents, as it is and has been for years, rather than take a
disproportionate amount of our community and send it to a different school, allowing for two feeder systems of busses within the same community, and a significant amount of change for those students currently in the high school.Schools like TJ will continue to be underused, and Oakdale and Urbana will be overcapacity after a few more years of large-scale residential development.  Neither plan goes far enough to address the massive problems these schools are facing now or the
future.no, i would prefer option aI like ALake Linganore is a close knit community. Breaking up the kids would be a terrible idea and would make a lot of people very
unhappy if option B moved forward. Really hoping that option A wins out.NoThese look much better than original options which had smaller neighborhoods being bounced around from established feeder
patterns.overall goodI appreciate the increase in diversity and working on improving community groups in LHS feeder area.Option B is a horrible option creating a division in an awesome neighborhood. It completely disregards the reason many families
moved to this wonderful neighborhood.NaNoSame as aboveN/A.Like A, but not B. B pulls away from rest of LLA communityI believe you will have quite a fight on your hands if seniors are not grandfathered into their current high schools.No.It's interesting to hear people complain about the one section of Lake Linganore  (Meadows & Balmoral) carved out to go to Linganore instead of Oakdale. Do they realize that West Winds is a part of Lake Linganore as well?  Also, looking at a map, once the connection to Gas House Pike is finished,  it is probably a better option for these neighborhoods to attend Linganore anyway.
Probably saving on transportation costs for the school system.PB 154, 157, and 159 are established, completed Lake Linganore villages (Meadows and Balmoral villages) surrounding the lake in the Oakdale feeder. In option A, these would remain with all the other current villages in the community (excluding West Winds-PB146, which is currently in the Linganore feeder and has their own board). Option A is great from the perspective of the Lake Linganore neighborhood, which is very close knit and intertwined. In Option B, these villages (PB154, 157, 159) are now the only core Lake Linganore Villages in the Linganore Feeder. It seems a preferable split in option B would be to have PB 154, 157, and 159 remain with the rest of the current, already built Lake Linganore villages and have PB158, which will gain close to 900
homes when new development is started/complete, and PB146 (West Winds already in Linganore feeder) feed into LHS.nanI recommend moving the Lake Linganore Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows back into the OHS feeder under Option B. Though moving those villages in the LHS feeder helps to balance an elem to middle school split in the short term it goes against established criteria set forth by the Board and voted on my by the community. More negatives than positives are created for a
short term gain only as future growth in the area will cause splits to fluctuate anyway.I do not find option B feasible for several reasons including two feeder pattern busses in the community, sectioning  a portion of a large community to a different feeder pattern and other boundaries that seem to be mitigating factor on our community being redistricted already is involved in a divided pattern with LHS/UHS and WKMS, which feeds into both.  Option A has our community and it's established relationships continuing a cohesive  positive school environment.  My opinion has nothing to do with the quality of LHS.  I think it is a great school with a great student and staff population.  It seems the decision comes down to redistricting WKMS/LHS/UHS kids or OHS/OMS kids.  WKMS already splits into UHS and LHS, making the possible redistricting less disruptive to schools, students and communities as there is already an established relationship within these 3
schools.  OHS and OMS have no established relationship.Needs to include all of Meadows going to Oakdale HighBoth options are great.  Please don't make any changes.I would prefer if we can take the best of both options A and B and still keep the majority of Lake Linganore students in Oakdale feeder. Rather than take Meadows and Balmoral villages (planning blocks 154, 157 and 159) out of Oakdale and sent to
Linganore feeder, keep those villages in Oakdale feeder and start Hampton East and West in Linganore feeder.Option B splits up Lake Linganore as if we are being punished and Ibelive that this is not fair for usI wish there was a combo of A and B that allows Urbana to have slightly lower attendance levels but keeps the new East County
ES in the Oakdale district.Moving the landsdale neighborhood to Linganore HS will significantly impact the commute time and safety. The Urbana HS is promimally closer and an easier commute for our neighborhood. Just because tyke numbers work out doesn't make it the most
logical option.There is absolutely NO need to switch the very small group of High School students to another High School then the rest of LLA.
Plus they were already restricted less than 10 years agoOption A will force my daughter to change schools her Junior yearOption A will force my daughter to change schools her Junior yearI think a combo of A and B would be best. Maintain the Oakdale feeder as is in Lake Linganore. Instead of removing Meadows and Balmoral villages (planning blocks 154, 157, 159) as option B suggests, keep those villages in Oakdale feeder as it affects less than 100 students. It keeps the community aspect of Lake Linganore that most residents want to preserve. Hamptons East and
West should be part of Linganore feeder from the beginning.If part of lake linganore will not be attending the same high school I think I larger portion of lake linganore should be split
between the two high schools. Not sectioning off a small portion of the community to send to a different high school.Please consider in whatever option you choose to keep the Meadows and Balmoral with the rest of their community.We moved here less than 2 years ago bc we wanted our children to attend our assigned schools. Now we are being shuffled to
new schools and I am concerned that the next redistricting study will move SRES into the GTJHS feeder pattern.Option A is the more preferred option based on the fact that the meadows village in the lake Linganore community would attend Oakdale high school, and would not be segregated from the rest of the community by having to attend a different high school.
Also, my youngest child will be a senior the year this goes into effect, which I certainly hope that he would not be expected to attend a different high school then where his older brother attended/graduated from in 2019 and for which he would have
attended for 3 years.Meadows does not have direct access to gas house pike like Woodridge...Keep the Oakdale Feeder for LLA as it has been.From my understanding there were 3 original plans which all had my subdivision The Meadows staying at Oakdale High. Not sure when or WHY  it switched but with the new plans Option B has the Meadows going to Linganore.  We have lived there for 20+ years and my son will be a senior at Oakdale when this goes into effect and that is totally unfair to have a kid switch schools for their senior year.  This would be a huge impact on the kids and I totally disagree with it!   Senior Year is a BIG DEAL and the Seniors should have the option to finish out their senior year where they currently are!!!  These kids have developed many friendships from going to the same school with the same kids for so many years.  They have great relationships with teachers and play sports for their school and this plan would totally uproot them and have them start all over when this should be one of
the best years of their lives...  I beg you to please allow the seniors to stay where they are at if option B goes into effect.  Thank you!The Meadows should not be split from the rest of Lake Linganore. I've heard about an option that would move the meadows back but not the new Hamptons. Our children have already formed tight bonds with all the areas of LL and should not be split
up.PLEASE consider with either option that you keep the established communities of Lake Linganore together (Balmoral /
Meadows).  New development can be included with the West Winds and LHS feeders but Balmoral / Meadows should stay with what they've known for the benefit of the less than 100 kidsBoth are acceptable as the they move the kids directly from OMS to OHS.I think the best option relies upon a combo of A and B. Keep planning blocks 154, 157 and 159 in Oakdale feeder. Hamptons East and West should join Linganore feeder with WestWinds. The # of affected students in the aforementioned planning blocks is under 100. Please don't remove them from the schools which almost the entire rest of our community attend. Lake Linganore is an extremely tight-knit, active neighborhood. These kids see their school friends constantly at neighborhood events and activities. Please don't remove them and put them in a feeder with students who's houses they can't walk or ride their bikes to
like they do now.Again my son is working on his high school credit at Oakdale Middle School preparing for Oakdale HS so this will be highly disruptive if Option B is selected. For any kid in that is already in late elementary, middle or high school this will be highly disruptive and emotionally stressful.
Impact on communities was high on the list of priorities. So if we are under utilizing the high school why split a community in this option?
And in 5 to 8 years in both options we will need to reassess again because we are basically around the 100% mark again and this
is in both options regardless, so why impact communities so much?Option A is the best optionI do not like how Option B separates Planning Blocks 154, 157 and 159 from the rest of the Lake LInganore community.During the June meeting, we learned that under Option B the Lake Linganore Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows would be redistricted into the LHS feeder. We were told by Mr. Cropper during the June meeting, that we were moved into the LHS feeder simply to balance an elementary to middle school split and not to alleviate crowding at the middle school or high school level.
We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances "out year"ù overcapacity rates between LHS and OHS under this option.
Reasons why:
- Capacity and School Utilization Numbers:
o Balmoral and the Meadows have an average of 100 students at each school level. That is a very small amount of students to move from the greater Lake Linganore community. Lake Linganore is a well-connected community both physically and socially through trails that connect our neighborhood and community events. We feel that the small amount of students pulled into the LHS feeder would isolate these students socially from the greater community.
o Under Option B, moving Balmoral and the Meadows to the LHS feeder has little impact on capacity numbers at all school levels (less than 1 percent). In fact, moving us back to the OMS/OHS feeder under Option B would create a more balanced utilization rate at both the middle and high school levels.
- Redistricting Criteria:
o Per Policy 200.2, the Board set criteria for redistricting that is intended to guide the final decision. During the January voting, community members choose their top three criteria as priorities for consideration. Two of those criteria were Impact on Neighborhoods and Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. Moving us out of the OHS feeder goes against the criteria of maintaining existing feeders and would negatively impact our neighborhood and community by socially isolating a small number of students from their peers in the larger community.
o Our neighborhood was redistricted from LHS into OHS just 8 years ago. It seems due to our location, we could be in a situation of continually flip flopping between feeders as additional schools are build. The Board's criteria also includes keeping redistricting to a minimum.
- Split Feeders:
o It was clear from the March survey that parents prefer to avoid split feeders. Option B creates a split feeder at the elementary level. Additionally, a desire to have an even split moving from one school level to the next is not part of the overall redistricting criteria set forth by the Board and should not take priority over other factors when making a decision to alter an existing feeder pattern.
o Moving us into the NMMS/LHS feeder simply to achieve a 50/50 elementary to middle school split in the near term is not a sound reason to make a drastic change for these students. Hamptons West has yet to be built and could easily provide a better split balance as the homes are developed. As projection numbers are not always correct, trying to achieve a short term balance may result in a long-term imbalance as projection numbers have been incorrect in the past.
- Lastly, the Lake Linganore Village of Woodridge had the March Option B (redistricted to GTJMS) removed from consideration as a result of their vocal petition despite the low utilization rate of GTJMS under both of the current options. Clearly indicating that even splits and capacity utilization are a lower priority compared to Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. As our recommendation does not create an over capacity situation in either option, we should be afforded the same consideration in order to remain at OMS and OHS.
Thank you for allowing me to express my thoughts and I strongly hope your take our concerns for our children and the community into consideration.It excludes just the neighborhood that I currently live in from the rest of the linganore communityPlease keep Lake Linganore students together.Meadows and Balmoral Villages should remain in Oakdale high School.We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances "out year"ù overcapacity rates between LHS and OHS under this option.

Kids grow up and go to college and then there will be less children and there will be a boundary shift back again so why do it?  There also will be more development to fill in for the population fluctuations. A new Elementary school makes sense
but these Options seem unnecessary.Again. Summerfield will be so much closer when they develop the land across from Deer Crossing.  There will be a road that
connects boyers mill road and 75.  The main route to Linganore High School is gas house pike.  There is a section of road that is extremely dangerous for new drivers.  There was a high schooler killed several years ago on that part of Gas House pikeI'm not sure why you changed the last 3 proposals.  Maybe too much pressure from Ryan homes?  The neighborhoods across from Spring Ridge (on 144) are closer to TJ than Spring Ridge.  Why not relieve the middle schools /high schools by sending
those neighborhoods to TJ?We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances "out year"ù overcapacity ratesChanging schools is hard enough. Changing schools as a high school freshman is dangerous. I did it myself. Trying to start all over while keeping you're grades up and trying to fit in is extremely tough. HS is hard. Let's not make it any harder on these kids. Please keep them at oakdale. I bought my house, I made this huge financial decision,  so my child could attend Oakdale

Students have already planned their future regarding class availability (which will have an impact on their future college and career choice).AgreeAs residents Meadows LLA, we would prefer to remain with the other established LLA villages (with the exception of West Winds, which due to its proximity to LHS is currently and would remain in the LHS feeder). Please move Meadows and
Balmoral back into the OMS/OHS feeder under Option B.I believe the county should do what is in the best interests for the kids -- not just look at numbers.The high school has not been impactedI felt that the option A was the better choice.  It really take the neighborhoods in account and keeps neighbors together better.Keep Lake Linganore as one community. Do NOT separate out if the impact on schools is inconsequential.I prefer option A over BI am very happy with both options A and B for the high school.I strongly feel DRAFT Option A is a better option for the Lake Linganore community.

and social interactions of my children with peers in the lake linganore communityOption B is my preference because it keeps enrollment down at OHS and seemingly lessens our chance of being redistricted to
TJH in the futureNoI don't understand why the Lake Linganore Villages of Balmoral and Meadows were moved to the NMMS/LHS feeder under Option B. It does not seem necessary for capacity reasons as the projected capacity rate will actually be higher at LHS under this option then it would be at OHS in 2028. And this option was not part of any of the original options presented to the community; in fact I know some in the neighborhood are still unaware that a new option was created. Furthermore it goes against the preferred criteria of Established Feeders and Impact on Communities. Seems odd to move this small group of students to a new middle/high school feeder. It would isolate them from the greater Lake Linganore community. If this option is chosen, I would hope the BOE would consider grandfathering in more than just high school seniors as it is essentially removing 20-30 students at each grade level and placing them in a new school. That seems unfair socially. Current per grade enrollment is roughly 250 students at the middle school level and 400 at the high school level. Why move such a small number of students? It's doesn't achieve the goal of reducing capacity at the high school level. I don't understand what it achieves. And never mind we were just
redistricted to OHS only 8 years ago. Why ping pong us back again?Strongly recommend against removing the Meadows from Oakdale. This isn't where the future community growth is coming
from anyway.Plan B is NOT Good - Keep Lake Linganore all going to Oakdale High.At least we get to go to Oakdale HighnoneKeeping parts of Lake Linganore that currently go to OMS and OHS, still going to OMS and OHS is a priority for that
communityThis is in regard to Option B:  the Lake Linganore Village of Woodridge had the March Option B (redistricted to GTJMS) removed from consideration as a result of their vocal petition despite the low utilization rate of GTJMS under both of the current options. Clearly indicating that even splits and capacity utilization are a lower priority compared to Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. My comments re Option B does not create an over capacity situation (in either option A or B), therefore, we should be afforded the same consideration in order to remain at OMS and OHS.  Also, Moving us out of the OHS feeder goes against the criteria of maintaining existing feeders and would negatively impact our neighborhood and community
by socially isolating a small number of students from their peers in the larger community.Draft B keeps enrollment at OHS lower making it less likely that we would have to redistrict this same group of kids again.With Option A I am concerned that Oakdale High will become overcrowded in a few years. I prefer Option B.Prefer that TJ High not be considered as an option in further revisionIt makes absolutely no sense to bus Spring Ridge kids to TJHSI like Option A the best.NoNoIf Option B is the elected plan, I request that a modification be considered. 1. Since Hampton West has not yet been development, it would make sense for them to attend Linganore HS. This would provide a better split balance. The home builders could communicate this from the beginning. 2. Please keep Meadows and Balmoral subdivisions of Lake Linganore with the rest of the Association at Oakdale HS. The amount of students per grade in this development is minimal in comparison to Hampton West.For these students to be removed from the community they have become successfully established in could cause negative outcomes. They would have to start over socially but since they would be the only students from LLA to have to make the transition, they would more than likely not get in classes with their neighboring peers. They would have to start over as a small group versus if all of LLA were also transferring then the impacted students would be a larger group. The majority of  students impacted from the Meadows and Balmoral would be a sophomore or higher making the transfer more difficult. Although both are great high schools, removing only these two subdivisions of LLA would negatively impact their ties in the LLA community. Most of these families have been established in the development and community for many years, in comparison to the new developments. Thank you for your consideration and hard work on this project. I definitely agree that the overcrowding in these
schools needs addressed.I want my kids to go to the schools closest to our home and stay within same feeder pattern.The high school option for our neighborhood is a different feeder pattern than elementary or middle school. The only kids my child will know when they get to high school will be those from our neighborhood.  This will make integration really hard
socially on our children at a critical time in their academic career.It doesn't make sense to send kids all the way out to linganore high when the road to Oakdale high essentially comes to our
neighborhoodB is better bc it keeps OHS enrollment lower, hopefully avoiding another district adjustment in the near future.I prefer A but I like them both.Option B splits off portions of Linganore that doesn't make sense for neighborhood continuity.option A makes more sense for the community.We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances "out year"ù overcapacity rates between LHS and OHS under this option. Reasons why:
- Capacity and School Utilization Numbers:
o Balmoral and the Meadows have an average of 100 students at each school level. That is a very small amount of students to move from the greater Lake Linganore community. Lake Linganore is a well connected community both physically and socially through trails that connect our neighborhood and community events. We feel that the small amount of students pulled into the LHS feeder would isolate these students socially from the greater community.
o Under Option B, moving Balmoral and the Meadows to the LHS feeder has little impact on capacity numbers at all school levels (less than 1 percent). In fact, moving us back to the OMS/OHS feeder under Option B would create a more balanced out year utilization rate at both the middle and high school levels.
- Redistricting Criteria:
o Per Policy 200.2, the Board set criteria for redistricting that is intended to guide the final decision. During the January voting, community members choose their top three criteria as priorities for consideration. Two of those criteria were Impact on Neighborhoods and Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. Moving us out of the OHS feeder goes against the criteria of maintaining existing feeders and would negatively impact our neighborhood and community by socially isolating a small number of students from their peers in the larger community.
o Our neighborhood was redistricted from LHS into OHS just 8 years ago. It seems due to our location, we could be in a situation of continually flip flopping between feeders as additional schools are built. The Board's criteria also includes keeping  redistricting to a minimum.
- Split Feeders:
o It was clear from the March survey that parents prefer to avoid split feeders. Option B creates a split feeder at the elementary level. Additionally, a desire to have an even split moving from one school level to the next is not part of the overall redistricting criteria set forth by the Board and should not take priority over other factors when making a decision to alter an existing feeder pattern.
o Moving us into the NMMS/LHS feeder simply to achieve a 50/50 elementary to middle school split in the near term is not a sound reason to make a drastic change for these students. Hamptons West has yet to be built and could easily provide a better split balance as the homes are developed. As projection numbers are not always correct, trying to achieve a short term balance may result in a long-term imbalance as projection numbers have been incorrect in the past.
o Lastly, the Lake Linganore Village of Woodridge had the March Option B (redistricted to GTJMS) removed from consideration as a result of their vocal petition despite the low utilization rate of GTJMS under both of the current options. Clearly indicating that even splits and capacity utilization are a lower priority compared to Impact on Communities and Established Feeder
Patterns. As our recommendation does not create an over capacity situation in either option, we should be afforded the same consideration in order to remain at OMS and OHS.I want BWe are pleased that our planning block 63 is now staying in the Oakdale feeder for both optionsWe are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances "out year"ù overcapacity rates between LHS and OHS under this option.

Clearly indicating that even splits and capacity utilization are a lower priority compared to Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. As our recommendation does not create an over capacity situation in either option, we should be afforded the same
consideration in order to remain at OMS and OHS.NoDo what's best for the school system not the crazy people.  My kids may all be redistricted if option B is selected.  Guess what, they will still get on a bus that will take them to a good school and they will have friends and they will learn and they will play sports.  They will not be socially isolated or have mental issues for the rest of their lives because of this.  We will be happy and
fine either way.As stated before, it is the most valuable option. It seems to be a better fix across the board for all Frederick communities. The Urbana area is wide spread so Option A accomplishes better feeder patterns, more balance demographically, and better fix to
Over Crowding.During the March LOU Redistricting meeting, we learned that our neighborhood (Planning Block 154 - Meadows village in Lake Linganore) was to remain in the OHS feeder under all 3 options. We were told that no new options would be created, that only combinations of the existing options would be presented in June. During the June meeting, we learned that under Option B the Lake Linganore Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows would be redistricted into the LHS feeder. This came as a surprise to many in our neighborhood. We were told by Mr. Cropper that we were moved into the LHS feeder simply to balance an elementary to middle school split. As previously stated, this is not a criterion listed in Board Policy 200.2. This runs counter to the wishes of the community.
Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns are listed as criteria for the Board and were two of the highest priorities from the community from the January meeting. Moving us out of the OHS feeder under Option B certainly goes against attempting to maintain existing feeders and would negatively impact our neighborhood and community by socially isolating a small number of students from their peers in the larger Lake Linganore community.
I would like to note that the Lake Linganore Village of Woodridge, which was designated to feed into GTJMS under the March Option B, was subsequently removed from consideration in the new options, clearly indicating that even splits and capacity utilization are a lower priority compared to Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns.
My recommendation is to include the Meadows and Balmoral Villages of Lake Linganore in the OMS and OHS feeder pattern under Option B, which is clearly aligned with these top two priorities and we should be afforded the same consideration as the rest of the Lake Linganore community.  Further, this would create a more balanced utilization rate at both the middle and high school levels.
Proximity to school is another criteria set forth by the Board. There are other Planning Blocks closer to NMMS than the blocks within Balmoral and the Meadows. Utilizing this criteria is suspect at best.
Finally, our neighborhood was redistricted from LHS into OHS just 8-9 years ago; a new school the lake community embraced. Moving us again seems like a rash decision considering there is likely to be yet another redistricting in the out years as there is a clear need for additional schools to be constructed in the area. It seems due to our location, we could be in a situation of continually flip flopping between feeders. This should be avoided, as I know one of the Board's criteria is to keep redistricting to
a minimum.Please. Keep us together and don't let the overdevelopment of our area come between our homes and familiesNoNot at this time since my kids aren't school aged yet but one of the main reasons we recently moved into the neighborhood was
for the Oakdale schools.My response to each option is the same: It is important to keep kids in the same feeder for all three levels of ES, MS, HS. Looking at the maps, I am thinking Option B keeps more of the kids together for all 3 levels. Option B will also prevent overcrowding at
Oakdale High and Oakdale Middle, especially as the developments near those schools continue to grow.Option B splits 2 neighborhoods off from the entire Lake Linganore community. We all share amenities, sports teams, etc.Unfortunately, the redistricting process is inherently flawed because it only involves a portion of the county.  This places immediate limitations on where students and communities can attend schools and where individual planning blocks can shift to; thus this process is less responsive to the population growth of the county.  For example, only addressing the portion of students attending TJ Middle residing east of the Monacacy River rather than all students attending, or who could attend, TJ Middle places severe limitations on options for shifting planning blocks to fully utilize TJ Middle.  I don't believe you can adequately or equitably address the redistricting needs of the county by doing a partial redistricting of the county.  We need to get this right. We need full county redistricting.  It's better to take the time to get it right than to push through a partial attempt that gets it
wrong for years to come and that is more costly.  The question is, who is brave enough to do what's right?Only redistricting part of the county limits where students and communities can attend schools and where individual planning
blocks can shift to.  You cannot address the needs of the county by only doing a partial redistricting of the county.My same general comment about the undefined criteria and lack of a comprehensive set of metrics applies to all the schools in the study.  Do the options satisfy the criteria to a greater or lesser degree than the existing districts?  No one knows because well defined metrics have not been developed.  Has the process of developing concepts and options converged ?  No one knows because not even the cost has been calculated and that is the only metric in the study to be optimized at present.   Instead your effort has focused on varying what should be constraints in the problem (eg. utilization, FARM rates).  Those are not the most suitable  objectives.
The redistricting effort should go back to the start, define the criteria (not just list them in a document), develop a set of quantitative metrics that are shared with the public and then used to find the optimal boundary configuration.  Unless this is
done, your effort is making ad hoc corrections to the boundaries in a highly irregular and inconsistent  manner.We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances "out year"ù overcapacity rates between LHS and OHS under this option.

I don't get it. We are a part of the same HOA and my kid has friends south and west of us in the other communities and even in Woodsworth Estates.  I've consistently been worried about him being separated from people he knows and I don't like him being pulled a part
from them like option B does.It would be best to keep planning blocks 154, 157, and 159 with the other Lake Linganore planning blocks in the vicinity and keep them at Oakdale HS in the established feeder pattern no matter what option is proposed. The small number of students in
these planning blocks should not be cut off from the rest of the neighborhood and sent to LHS.Plan B is NOT Good - Keep Lake Linganore all going to Oakdale High
