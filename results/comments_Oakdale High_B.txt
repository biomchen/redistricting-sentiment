I am thrilled that this option keeps the Spring Ridge community at Oakdale High School.  It is the closest high school to the community and many students have older siblings who have already gone through OHS, so it is nice that families who have already built a sense of school pride and have become immersed in that
school community can continue.We remain in the OHS district which is goodWe do not like option B, it needlessly splits up the neighborhoods.I do not like option B.  It  It will divide a few streets in the community to a different high school making carpools, community and school spirit difficult and produces bus issues.  Option A allows the entire community to stay together and seems the more prudent and feasible option.  Option B has too many issues
and complications arising from only a few streets in the neighborhood to be redistricted.Nothing.  It is ridiculous to separate a tiny neighborhood from the rest of lake linganore.  Doing so would be
a terrible terrible decision.I don't like it.Allows for future development around Oakdale High School, not to be over capacity when build out is
complete. AT least that's my interpretation.NOTHINGSplits our kids to a new school and isolates our neighborhood. Could not be any more opposed.Staying in the OHS Feederthe students stay in the same middle and high schoolBalance of school utilization- again very neededOption B is awful. There should be no splitting of the lake Linganore communityI like that all options keep feeders together!0Provides more even relief to Urbana and Oakdale, especially in future projections. But I am skeptical about the projection data... Urbana HS in Option B has all of the attendance area in Option A plus a few Planning Blocks around Kemptown. How is the projected attendance for Urbana High School in Option B LOWER
than Option A?Do not likeNothingNOTHING!!!Do not likeKids who go to new market middle will move on to Linganore high. I like the feeder patterns sticking
togetherThis option addresses some crowding issues at both OHS & UHSNothingNothingnanMothingNothingNothingNothing. Stop messing with lake linganore.Same schoolI oppose this plan.I do not like option BDo not acceptNothingWe stay at Oakdale.Option B moves our high schoolers to Linganore which does not offer the Leadership program. While Linganore offers an engineering program, that it a tailored program only few want to participate in. If you are not interested in engineering, it teaches nothing else. Oakdale's Leadership Program provides guidance
for any role you want to pursue.Oakdale doesn't seem to be impacted too much, so we like that.Poorly designed, splitting up a small area to go to linganore instead of oakdale. Poor decision making on
FCPS' partJust as I stated about the middle school, he would it bea good option to split up a community in this way?  It
will definitely create a divide amongst the Lake Linganore community.I do not like this option as it splits kids that have grown up together.Will the meadows be at Linganore no matter what in the future?When I type in my address on the interactive map, the pop up lists OHS but the color changes to LHS so I
am not sure what high school we are planned for in this option.Nothing. Keep Lake Linganore together. They all,should go to Oakdale Schools.Nothing it splits up our neighborhoodDo not acceptNothingNothingI don't like it.It keeps the Linganore pattern together. Best choice in my opinion.NoneI am satisfied with the the facility (LHS) and the community feeding into the school being comparable to
that of  our current feeder pattern, Oakdale High SchoolAgain, absolutely nothing.This is a terrible option, and whomever thought it up should be ashamed of themselves.spring ridge moves together through the pathNothing...my sons LOVE OHSnothingI like that Spring Ridge stays at OHSDid not review as has little impact on my familyI do not like anything about option B.It would be fine if you remembered to add Balmoral and Meadows to stay with the rest of their community
of Lake Linganore.  It would be detrimental to keep the entire community together except our few streets.I don't find option B feasible due to the division of the community/village.I do not like Option B as it splits off sections of the neighborhood.i don't like it b/c it separates the neighborhood kidsI dislike itAbsolutely none. Despise this option.Same as aboveI like that it keeps PB63 in Oakdale ES, MS and HS. This is the current alignment which makes most sense as we are the closes established neighborhood to all three schools. I also like that it keeps PB 63 in Oakdale MS
and HS rather than sending us all over the map for each transition.noneKeeps kids in feeder patternThis option allows for our children to attend Oakdale HS, which was a large factor in building in
WoodridgeNothing - We live in the Lake Linganore/Meadows. I do not like this option because it separates my
children with the other kids in our community. The whole reason move to this area was for this close knit community.I strongly feel that improving the diversity of LHS would be great improved with adding these neighborhoods. Additionally, they are closer to Westwinds, which already go to NMMS and LHS so this
makes sense.Nothing, it completely divides the Lake Linganore  community by having one neighborhood go to
Linganore HSThis option seems most balanced to everyoneI don'tI do not like this option as it separates out neighborhoodSpreads the projected over capacity better so although all three are over capacity, it reduces the percentages of Oakdale and Urbana compared to option a which has two of the three over capacity but with a significant
discrepancy of student numbers to Linganore HS.  It also impacts fewer overall students.We don't have to changeNothing there would be no point in unincluding the Meadows neighborhood in Oakdales district.Same as aboveN/A.Nothingdislike - separate out from LLA commuinityNothingOakdale HSI like that in the long term projects, the over crowding is minimized in all the high schools better than in
option A.I do not like option B  I would prefer that all of the Meadows section of Lake Linganore stay at OHSnanI feel this option is well done with one exception. The Meadows/Balmoral village of Lake Linganore. Why
not keep them as Oakdale feeder? Less than 100 kids.It spreads out over capacity rates BUT it unnecessarily pulls the Lake Linganore Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows into the LHS feeder thus cutting a small portion of students off from the greater Lake Linganore community. We live in PB 154. See my reasoning under the Middle School Option B comment why this goes against Board criteria and priorities set forth by the January survey. And it has little bearing
on utilization rates; in fact keeping these villages under OHS helps to balance numbers.Nothing.  It divides our neighborhood so that only a very small portion of our neighborhood would go to Linganore.  It does not make sense to have inexperienced drivers driving difficult roads a further distance. It also doesn't make sense to divide a small portion of one neighborhood from the rest of the neighborhood.
This is a community.I do not like draft option B.NotjingKeeps kids close to schools - limits travel times.Better overcrowding reductionno good outcomeWe like that we can go to all three local schoolsSpreads out attendance numbers a little better.NothingLikeLikeI believe it does a better job addressing overcrowding.I like that option B appears to address possible future over crowding at the high school level.I am fine with the majority of it but we are missing a small chunk of Lake Linganore (balmoral and meadows) and this goes against Mr. Coopers statement in the Frederick Post where  he assured residents that "great effort will be made not to split up communities and if a community has to move, they move
together"I like that attendance levels are lower over time.My oldest is already considering LHS because if the engineering program so this would already put us in
districtI like that High School Draft Option B will keep our children at Oakdale High School. We moved to this
area, from out of state, specifically for the Oakdale High School system.NothingOakdale feeder remains.Switching schools would affect the community as a whole - you are pulling out a small section of kids who have grown up together in this community and moving them to another school. I think that would be
horrible....The Meadows should not be split from the rest of Lake Linganore. I've heard about an option that would
move the meadows back but not the new Hamptons. Our children have already formed tight bonds with all the areas of LL and should not be split upI am fine with the majority of it but we are missing a small chunk of Lake Linganore (balmoral and meadows) and this goes against Mr. Coopers statement in the Frederick Post where  he assured residents that "great effort will be made not to split up communities and if a community has to move, they move
together"Our Kids come directly from OMS to OHSI believe this option does a slightly better job addressing the overcrowding issues.Option B splits more people from our community which will be heartbreaking from the children of our community. Again in Lake Linganore we have a very strong feeling of belonging to a community. Our children already go to the high schools events and many of them even at the middle school level are already playing sports at the high school. Some of them do the equestrian team. This will be heartbreaking to be separated and isolated from this.
Option B also has a less balanced rate of utilization at the high school level with Oakdale being under utilized at 78% , Linganore 94% and Urbana 93%. This also is the reason I don't understand why would you split a community to under utilize the  High school. You only split a community if the rate of utilization is too high. I though Impact on communities were high on the priority list and we can't compare Lake
Linganore to other communities because we are very integrated and have been very small for a while.I like how high school draft option B has consistent feeder patterns.If you go with OPTION B I would recommend leaving Balmoral/Meadows with the OMS and OHS feeder
pattern (see detail in my observations below)NothingNothing.We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances â€œout yearâ€ù overcapacity rates between LHS and OHS under this option. Reasons why:
- Capacity and School Utilization Numbers:
o Balmoral and the Meadows have an average of 100 students at each school level. That is a very small amount of students to move from the greater Lake Linganore community. Lake Linganore is a well connected community both physically and socially through trails that connect our neighborhood and community events. We feel that the small amount of students pulled into the LHS feeder would isolate these students socially from the greater community.
o Under Option B, moving Balmoral and the Meadows to the LHS feeder has little impact on capacity numbers at all school levels (less than 1 percent). In fact, moving us back to the OMS/OHS feeder under Option B would create a more balanced out year utilization rate at both the middle and high school levels.
- Redistricting Criteria:
o Per Policy 200.2, the Board set criteria for redistricting that is intended to guide the final decision. During the January voting, community members choose their top three criteria as priorities for consideration. Two of those criteria were Impact on Neighborhoods and Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. Moving us out of the OHS feeder goes against the criteria of maintaining existing feeders and would negatively impact our neighborhood and community by socially isolating a small number of students from their peers in the larger community.
o Our neighborhood was redistricted from LHS into OHS just 8 years ago. It seems due to our location, we could be in a situation of continually flip flopping between feeders as additional schools are built. The Board's criteria also includes keeping redistricting to a minimum.
- Split Feeders:
o It was clear from the March survey that parents prefer to avoid split feeders. Option B creates a split feeder at the elementary level. Additionally, a desire to have an even split moving from one school level to the next is not part of the overall redistricting criteria set forth by the Board and should not take priority over other factors when making a decision to alter an existing feeder pattern.
o Moving us into the NMMS/LHS feeder simply to achieve a 50/50 elementary to middle school split in the near term is not a sound reason to make a drastic change for these students. Hamptons West has yet to be built and could easily provide a better split balance as the homes are developed. As projection numbers are not always correct, trying to achieve a short term balance may result in a long-term imbalance as projection numbers have been incorrect in the past.
o Lastly, the Lake Linganore Village of Woodridge had the March Option B (redistricted to GTJMS) removed from consideration as a result of their vocal petition despite the low utilization rate of GTJMS under both of the current options. Clearly indicating that even splits and capacity utilization are a lower priority compared to Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. As our recommendation
does not create an over capacity situation in either option, we should be afforded the same consideration in order to remain at OMS and OHS.Nothing!NoNoNoNothingNothingNothing.OHS great schoolOMS is a great schoolI don't.Since moving into the Oakdale district, my child has been more successful in school while also becoming
more comfortable.It keeps our neighborhood togetherSame as elementaryThe projected numbers appear to have less overcrowding.I do not like itSameAgreeExcellent see above .Keep Lake Linganore as one community. Do NOT separate out if the impact on schools is inconsequential.I like draft option B as well and for the same reasons as I mentioned above in the MS options.  I think this ends up serving the community about equally between option A and option B.  I believe Oakdale and
Linganore are very comparable on academic performance and learning opportunities for the students.This is not a good DRAFT for our community.same as at the middle school level it moves a tiny neighborhood from our community and isolates our kids,
my son would be going to his first year of High with basically no friends just a few neighbors.No preference as my children will go to Oakdale in either proposal.Nothing!I am not in favor of option B, as it negatively impacts the community of lake Linganore, specifically the village of the meadows - through redistricting to a new High School (Linganore). Limited Community
impact was acknowledged as a top priority by FCPS in the redistricting process.Nothing, it separates the Lake Linganore community reducing critical social interactionsIn favorVery little change between current boundaries and proposedPB154 - It better balances out capacity across schools but we do not like this option as it moves our children
to NMMS and LHSPlan B is NOT Good - Keep Lake Linganore all going to Oakdale High.It's the closest school to our house, so that's nice.Moves the Meadows to Linganore High and for many kids in that neighborhood, they would miss out on
staying in the Oakdale system and would break the Lake community.Plan B is NOT Good - Keep Lake Linganore all going to Oakdale High.At least we get to go to Oakdale HighSame as AnonrNothing.  This option has our children moving schoolsThe whole neighborhood going to the same high school school while keeping the capacity lower and keeps
us part of the Lou community that the children have always been apart of.Like that Oakdale has higher educational scoringi like that this option lessens the amount of students at OHS so OHS does not become overcrowded as
quickly.Attendance size decompressionI only like this option if the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows (PB154, 157, and 159) be moved back into
the OHS feeder as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances â€œout yearâ€ù overcapacity rates between LHS and OHS under this option.I would like Option B to keep Spring Ridge kids at Oakdale High. It also keeps numbers at OHS down and
its best for our kids.Preserves feeder patternOakdale is much closerBetter balance of utilization among the study area high schools in terms of projected enrollment.I like that spring ridge goes to oakdale.Better for my family as far as proximityI think this is a great option because it allows the Lake Linganore (Meadows) kids to get back to the roots of going to Linganore and NMMS! I love the idea of splitting Lake Linganore so the kids can meet other kids
from different neighborhoods.fineGood. (Oakdale) same feeder pattern as thier middle and elementary.It keeps our neighborhood together.Do not support Option B as it splits Balmoral and Meadows from rest of Linganore to go to NME and
LinganoreMore desirableMy neighborhood stays in the current feeder pattern.not a fanI do not like this optionNot a lotOverall does a better job addressing overcrowding among the 3 feedersI want my children to graduate from their attended school.That we are in the Oakdale feederThere would be less children attending oakdale high school which is needed as there are multiple housing developments planned in this area. Linganore has lower counts so additional children could be moved to
Linganore and help the over populated oakdale high.My children would maintain consistency in the Oakdale feeder pattern.Plan B is not good. Keep Lake Linganore all going to Oakdale High.Plan B is NOT Good - Keep Lake Linganore all going to Oakdale High.Nothing in its current draft form.That it will keep the meadows and balmoral at Oakdale and our communities togetherI orefer this option.I like that our neighborhood kids in Greenview will go to Oakdale for high school with their friends from ES
and MS.Keeps OHS less utilizedJust like with middle school, most of linganore is together except for the meadows. The only piece that is
missing is the meadows.That my children would be districted to a school with lower enrollment.A and B are the same for us given our planning block (1).No difference.I do NOT like this option, for the reasons I stated above in the discussion of middle school options.Utilization of OHS is a bit lower than A.Option B allows for slightly less overcrowding at the middle and high school levels, but does so at the expense of students in PB 154, 157, and 159. If Option B were modified to move these planning blocks back to OMS/OHS, while maintaining NMMS/LHS for the not-yet-developed PB 158, this would create a more balanced out year utilization rate at both the middle and high school levels. Removing the aforementioned
planning blocks has only a 1% impact on overcrowding numbers at the middle and high school levels.I don't like that it puts Meadows and Balmoral in the LHS feederBreaking up the Meadows and Balmoral into the LHS feeder seems short sighted.Nothing unless it stays in OHS.doesn't include new hamptons areasIt keeps future enrollment down at OHS.
