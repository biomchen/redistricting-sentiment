I am thrilled that this option keeps the Spring Ridge community at Oakdale High School.  It is the closest high school to the community and many students have older siblings who have already gone through OHS, so it is nice that families who have already built a sense of school pride and have become immersed in that
school community can continue.We remain in the OHS district which is goodIt keeps the Meadows together in the same schools.I like that the neighborhoods aren't divided by streets to go to different high schools.  I prefer and entire community or neighborhood go to the same school.  We are a very close community that rely on each other
for activities, carpools, family management.  I like that it allows for the current feeder pattern.Keeps Meadows / Balmoral with the rest of their communityIt keeps my girls in Oakdale High, one of the main deciding factors on moving here.It keeps all the neighborhoods of LL together, as they have been.Keeps our kids with their friends going to OakdaleThe Meadows and Balmoral are two closely linked neighborhoods within LLA that would be excluded from attending school in the same district as the rest of LLA that share Boyers Mill as the main entrance/exit to their villages.  Unlike West Winds, which already has an exclusive entrance/exit along Gas House Pike, and
also has their own covenants within the LLA, the Meadows and Balmoral should not be separated.Staying in the OHS feederOption A keeps the Meadows in the Oakdale feeder pattern.That my neighborhood is in the same school district.Keeps the Meadows at Oakdale.the students stay in the same middle and high schoolCapacity relief, although it is short termIt keeps the Eaglehead at Linganore boundaries intact.The lake Linganore community should be kept in the same Oakdale school districtThe Meadows stays in Oakdale high as promised when purchasing our home. The lake community is not
split up.Helps keep the Linganore community together in the most consistent way.  By consistent, I mean in terms of
how the current patterns are set up.  It also is the least damaging to the relationships in the community.It would allow my children to continue on their paths at Oakdale MS and HighThe villages of Lake Linganore are together through middle and high school as they are now. It seems unfair to cut off one village from the rest. Like Woodridgge was disappointed, with the first round, it is disappointing to see that now the Meadow and Balmoral are split. This confuses me since Pinehurst and Summerfield are closer to NMMS. I would love to see villages stay together and at the closest location. if
things gave to be divided, it makes more sense to me to divide the new houses not the established.EverythingProvides more relief to the Urbana, which is the most over capacity.Meadows/Balmoral stay with the rest of the community.  This greatly impacts neighborhood friendships
and sense of unityMy daughter will remain in same school she began inWonderful!!!Like itKids feed from oakdale middle to oakdale highNeighborhoods not being splitI don't.Keeps neighborhoods togetherOption A is great - keeps all Linganore kids that have been together since K together through high schoolKeep the lake Linganore community togetherKeeps our kids togetherI like that most Linganore communities are staying as is and will continue to attend OHS.i would like to see the lake linganore kids all go to the same high schoolIt keeps the community togetherMy daughter will remain in same school she began inKeep community togetherIt keeps lake Linganore together. Moving the kids out of the schools that they have gone through all of their
childhood leads to drug problems, issues with learning, and general lack of pride.Same schoolAgain, this keeps all of the existing kids from Lake Linganore together. Less transitions for the families. This
option keeps a larger portion of kids together for elementary, middle, and high.We are within Oakdale HS boundary linesIt keeps most of LL in the same schoolAcceptI like this option , our kids are closer to this schoolWe stay at Oakdale.It keeps our children at Oakdale HS. Oakdale has the Leadership Program which many of our children apply for and utilize to gain knowledge and become strong members of society. It is the only school in Frederick County to offer this to their students. As a parent of 2 children who are part of the Leaderships Program I can say it is teaching my children beyond the classroom on what makes and doesn't make great
leaders. It adds heavily to college applications.Appropriate feeder schoolsSame as above.Oakdale doesn't seem to be impacted too much, so we like that.It is definitely the better option because it keeps our whole community together.I like keeping the kids together that have been together throughout their school years.We stay at Oakdale with the rest of communityThat we are clearly still in the OHS area. The social reasons are obvious as her closest friends will remain at OHS but as far as safety, we never drive those back roads so I worry about the kids safety related to driving
that way especially with the flooding occurs on Gas House Pike between the Meadows and West Winds.My kids stay in the Oakdale district. My son is a sophomore going to ne a humidor next year and doesn't deserve to switch schools his senior year. That's just messed up. Also my girls have been working so hard with teachers and coaches at Oakdale and would have to start all over if they are moved.
Keep Lake Linganore together.Keeps the kids togetherAcceptThat most of Lake Linganore villages will remain together.It keeps most kids in there current school districts with there siblings and friends. It is also safer for teens to drive to Oakdale from the meadows and balmoral than to liganore high school on gas house pike, which is
not a very safe road.Keeps the community togetherMy daughter will be a Junior at OHS. She has been in this community since kindergarten. Option A allows
her to stay at OHS and complete her final two years with her childhood friends.Keeps LLA community togetherOur Lake Linganore Community remains intact.SameMy children remain districted with the peers in which they began school.  It allows them to continue their
current feeder pattern without the existing Lake Linganore Community being divided.It keeps my children and all of their friends together in school, and helps maintain a sense of community.Keeps community together.that the neighborhood is all togetherKeep us at OHSKeeps kids togetherKeeps all of Linganore neighborhoods togetherIt keeps ALL of Lake Linganore together through middle and high school (West Winds not included).I like that Spring Ridge stays at OHSRetains Oakdale HS for my families school districtI like that option A maintains community/neighborhood connections. Lake Linganore is an extremely tight knit community and carving out Meadows and Balmoral neighborhoods, aka planning blocks 154, 157 and 159 disrupts the community aspect many residents moved here for. Meadows and Balmoral are established, non-developer owned villages with no new large scale construction possible. Our student population doesn't have the potential for large growth. Please do not separate these students from their neighborhood
peers. Option A allows an entire development to stay together.Keeps the heart of Lake Linganore togetherIt will keep my child with the group of friends and parents that we have grown up with. High school is hard enough, so I feel strongly about disrupting this foundation that has been established through previous years. I do not agree with any plan that would take our children away from a group of peers that have
cultivated relationships with at this point. Draft A keeps them together and keeps them in the feeder school.I like that it keeps the current feeder pattern as it is and allows the entire community to stay together, as it
has for years.All of Lake Linganore stay together.keeps neighborhood kids togetherI like itKeeping the kids who they built relationships with throughout the neighborhoods together.It keeps the neighborhood connectedSame as above.  Like Oakdale schools.I like that it keeps PB63 in Oakdale ES, MS and HS. This is the current alignment which makes most sense as we are the closes established neighborhood to all three schools. I also like that it keeps PB 63 in Oakdale MS
and HS rather than sending us all over the map for each transition.includes Westwinds in Oakdale HS districtKeeps kids in feeder patternThis option allows for our children to attend Oakdale HS, which was a large factor in building in
WoodridgeI like this option as it keeps my children with others kids in our community (Lake Linganore).Keeps the Lake Linganore community together.Will keep LLA community children in the same schools as their neighborhood friends! Better sense of
community. Please don't split these kids up.It keeps the Linganore community together. To separate the Meadow community makes no sense.All of LLA, kids stay together.It keeps our neighborhood attending the same schoolsKeeps the community togetherIt keeps the neighborhood kids togetherAll of Lake Linganore including the Meadows is included in Oakdale.Same as aboveI like this one the best because it means my children will get to grow up going to the same school as their
friends and neighbors they've been in school with.Best option for my familyCommunity stays togethersupport - keeps with LLA communityMy daughter, who will be a senior at Oakdale High School remains at her high school.Oakdale HSThe Lake Linganore neighborhoods (except for West Winds) stay in the Oakdale feeder, providing
continuity of the current feeder pattern and also no divisions within the community.I like that the current OHS feeder pattern is kept in tactLake Linganore neighborhood stays togetherThis Option A seems to be a more clear feeder patternKeeps children in the grades together from the neighborhood.  Does not adversely affect children by
changing their schools on them.I like that the portions of the Lake Linganore community that are currently enrolled in Oakdale feeder
schools, remain with Oakdale.It keeps ALL of the Lake Linganore Villages within the OHS feeder pattern.It keeps all of the Meadows Neightborhood in Lake Linganore at Oakdale High School.  The Meadows neighborhood is closer to Oakdale than Linganore.  I do not want my inexperienced driver on crazy narrow twisted roads going further away than they already have to go.  These families are a community.  Why
would you want to separate them at the High School level??I like that is maintains the current feeder pattern and does not divide the community.Includes all of MeadowsKeeps kids close to schools - limits travel times.Keeping majority of Lake Linganore students in same feeder.All of Lake Linganore/Oakdale Middle School district stays togetherWe like that we can go to all three local schoolsKeeps us in the Oakdale district with most of Lake Linganore. I like that East Country ES (the new ES) will be with the Oakdale district, meaning kids that live in close proximity to one another can be part of the same
high school community.Keeps us at OHSDo not likeDo not likeI like that it allows for all of the Lake Linganore villages in Oakdale feeder to remain in Oakdale feeder.I like that all of lake linganore (except west winds) will attend the same high school.I appreciate the efforts to keep communities together.  As Mr Cooper is quoted in the Frederick Post as assuring residents that "great effort will be made not to split up communities and if a community has to move, they move together".  This is crucial for the small part of Balmoral and Meadows who could
potentially leave their community wit the the Option in plan B.I like that High School Draft Option A will keep our children at Oakdale High School. We moved to this
area, from out of state, specifically for the Oakdale High School system.The fact that the meadows village in the lake Linganore community would attend Oakdale high school, and would not be segregated from the rest of the community by having to attend a different high school. Also, my youngest child will be a senior the year this goes into effect, and in this option he would not be expected to attend a different high school then where his older brother attended/graduated from in 2019 and for
which he would have attended for 3 years.Good schools - keeps majority of LLA togetherOakdale Feeder remainsIt keeps Lake Linganore together and not just pulling out a very small section of the community to switch
schools.The Meadows should not be split from the rest of Lake Linganore. Our children have already formed tight
bonds with all the areas of LL and should not be split upI appreciate the efforts to keep communities together.  As Mr Cooper is quoted in the Frederick Post as
assuring residents that "great effort will be made not to split up communities and if a community has to move, they move together".Our kids come directly from OMS to OHSI like that the Oakdale feeder within Lake Linganore is kept as is.I like high school option A because it does not split my community in Lake linganore. Along the same lines it keeps utilization enrollment more balanced between the schools. Oakdale at 84% linganore at 97% and
urbana 85%. (Linganore is projected to go down in the future)Option A reduces the amount of time students will spend traveling on a school bus, allowing for additional time for sports, homework, and time spent with family and friends. While I am not personally impacted by either option, I'm strongly in favor of keeping residents of the LLA together. Residents within LLA pay a significant fee annually to live here and attend top rated schools. The families and children who live here attend events together and participate in recreational activities together, creating close relationships that
should not be separated.I like how High School Option A is consistent with feeder patterns and keeping communities together.I like option A at first glance because my feeder pattern would be unaffected and we would remain at our
current schoolsIt keeps the neighborhood that I currently live in (lake linganore meadows) in the Oakdale school districtLake Linganore community is kept together in the Oakdale feeder pattern.Meadows stays in OHSMeadows stays in OHSMeadows stays in OHSMeadows stays in OHSMeadows stays in OHSEverythingI prefer Oakdale High overall and I am hoping my children get to experience its' Science and IT programs.
Its our current feeder school and so it keeps the Lake Linganore community in the same schoolsMeadows would be forced to go to Linganore High SchoolThe route from Meadows to Linganore High is dangerous.  We lost a high schooler going to Linganore several years ago on a stretch of Gas House Pike.  Plus Woodridge is the only neighborhood to have direct access
To gas house pikeKeeps The Meadows and Balmoral in the same schools as the rest of Lake Linganore.It splits us away from our friends we've developed over the past 6 years and next 10Same as elementaryOur village remains in the established feeder patternIt allows my current 9th grader to remain at Oakdale HSOakdale's proximity to springridgeAgreeExcellent.  Keeps us in the same high school.It keeps my family in our home school & it does a better job at keeping neighborhoods together.Keep Lake Linganore as one community. Do NOT separate out if the impact on schools is inconsequential.Again, this option keeps the neighborhoods together.I like draft option A as it essentially keeps the existing boundary of the feeder pattern going to Oakdale
Highschool as it is now.I like that the Lake Linganore community stays together (minus West Winds which is already separate).I like it because it keeps my community together and impact the least number of children. it also has a more
balanced enrollment utilization at all levels.No preference as my children will go to Oakdale in either proposal.My child has been exceeding at a great level since moving to the OMS district. She will start high school next year. She is comfortable with classmates and in the school. My kids dont need any more change. Please
keep the Meadows in Lake Linganore in OHSThe fact that the village of meadows in lake Linganore does not get segregated from the rest of the current
lake Linganore villages by being redistricted away from Oakdale High School.my children would attend Oakdale high school keeping everyone in the lake linganore community at the
same school facilitating physical and social interactions with peersIn favorVery little change between current boundaries and proposedPB 154 - keeps the LL Villages of Balmoral and Meadows in the OMS/OHS feederIt's the closest school to our house, so that's nice.Keeps the Meadows in OHS and keeps OHS mostly the same - great consistencyAt least we get to go to Oakdale HighProximity, Maintaing same school feeder, entire development includednoneOption A keeps our children attending the same schoolLike that Oakdale has higher educational scoringCommunity UnityKeeps the part of Lake Linganore that go to OMS still at OHSThat PB154, 157, and 159 will continue to go to Oakdale High School.Preserves feeder patternNoneNo changes in the number of students in non-transported areas.I like that spring ridge goes to oakdaleIt keeps Lake Linganore kids together at the same school.NothingSame as above....keep current LLA as is...all new villages yet to be built have no say as no one is affected.It does not split out the Meadows and Balmoral.fineGood (oakdale)It keeps our neighborhood together.All of the communities that border the lake and summer field stay together in Lake LinganoreKeeping Linganorr kids together to go to OakdaleOakdale location is closer to my home and rated highly by past students. Part of the reason to move in the
Meadows was eaglehead would go through to Oakdale locations.Less desirableIt keeps neighborhoods together and my neighborhood won't be redistricted. My neighborhood stays in the
current feeder pattern.Neighborhood consistencyThis options allows peers to stay in cohortsThat a small part of Lake Linganore would remain at OHS where the rest of the neighborhood will attend.Maintains OHS feeder pattern in Lake LinganoreI vote BThat we are in the Oakdale feederNoMy children would maintain consistency in the Oakdale feeder pattern.Our Community in comparison to Urbana is small. We are tight knit and celebrate our wide diversity of income, ethnicity and values . It's a great culture to raise kids in. By moving an older community like Balmoral/Meadows to Linganore you will cause a divide in our community that will be hard to fix without impacting the very purpose of the redistricting. I am a Pinehurst resident, my kids will not change with either Option, I have friends in every Lake Linganore community. While I appreciate the board listening to the concerned parents in Woodridge and the new Community being built up there, to me it seems that it would have been better to send them to TJ, a below capacity school for many reasons. That said, I'm glad they will stay here but not at the cost of loosing an older community to Linganore and still not fixing
OverCrowding.I like that it keeps the villages of Meadows and Balmoral in the Oakdale High School feeder pattern and
keeps the Westwinds village where they want to be.nanI like that our neighborhood kids in Greenview will go to Oakdale for high school with their friends from ES
and MS.Same with middle school, we like option A since it keeps the Meadows with the rest of lake linganore. As I
mentioned before, this is an important aspect as children develop and grow.That it maintains existing feeder patterns and keeps our community together as a whole.A and B are the same for us given our planning block (1).No difference.I like that it keeps the Lake Linganore community together and in its established feeder pattern.It is suitable, but utilization is high. Also, what is the cost?  The only policy criteria with a quantitative metric appears not to have been calculated, or at least not shared with the public.  How can you optimize the districts without metrics that are well defined and explicitly mapped back to the policy criteria?  How
do the new options compare to the existing districts with regard to the criteria?  No one knows.Option A keeps all planning blocks in the Lake Linganore community feeding into OMS and then OHS
together, rather than removing approximately 100 students at each school level from PBs  154, 157, and 159.I like that it keeps the Meadows and Balmoral in the OHS feederIt is fineThat my area goes to OHS, I live in the meadows.don't like itOption A keeps the established and existing Lake Linganore villages that attend  Oakdale HS together.That the Meadows & Balmoral would still be included in Oakdale Highschool
