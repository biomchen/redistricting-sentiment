We prefer option A.I like being moved to East County ES because I am not happy about admin at our current schoolIt keeps us in our most local elementary school with our closest neighbors.nanLarger range of students in this plan.see aboveNothingnanNothing.Nothing you are splitting our neighborhood away from the rest of coldstream and linganore!!!!It's fineThe same answer listed above.nanNothingAll schools below 100% capacityNothingOption B is awful. There should be no splitting of the lake Linganore communityI like that both options keep feeders together.0Do not likeAvoid draft BNothingNothing!!!! It splits the communitySeems fineThe elementary schools will finally not be over crowdednanNot a fan.NothingNothingNothingWe are still at the same schoolsno commentI do not like option BacceptI don't like this optionI don't not like option B at all.I do not like option BnanI do not like splitting the kids.Glad to be at new schoolnanNothing.Nothing, it is splitting up our neighborhood.acceptThat those in the West Winds community who will go to LHS will be in ES with those students they will be
in HS with.It is an ok option, but option A is preferred.NothingNothingI have no problem with itIt keeps the Linganore pattern together. Best choice in my opinion.NoneN/A - by the time the school is built, I won't have an elementary school aged childStill nothingNothingnothingDid not review as has little to no impact on my familyI do not like anything about it.nannanThis doesn't effect my family. Both options have it redistricted from current.I understand the need for some areas to fill the new elementary school. I hope that the school will consider
opening with grades K-4 and keep 5th graders in their home school for that last year.i don't like it b/c it separates the neighborhood kidsNothingI don'tSame as above.noneSame as A. Makes senseRedistricting doesn't affect our ES child, but the areas seem to make senseThere is no difference between Option A and B for Elementary School.I like that it adds the meadows, balmoral and Westwinds moving over to NMMS and LHSI don'tThe new east county elementary will pull students from more than one existing elementary school.It will relieve Deer CrossingNothing.Option b doesn't affect me personally but it splits the community.ok - same either way for ES but not MS and HSnanI like that overcrowding at Deer Crossing is addressed and the division between Lake Linganore
neighborhoods is fairly equal.nanI do not like it as it creates a middle school split at the East County School and pulls the Lake Linganore Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows into the LHS feeder thus cutting a small portion of students off from
the greater Lake Linganore community. We live in PB 154.Both options have us at the same school.Includes all of meadowsAlso limits impact to existing school assignments.-no good outcomeIt doesn't change the school we attend at all, so seems fine to me.NothingUnsureUnsure-I prefer option A for elementary school.nanThat my kids won't be in an overcrowded ES. Youngest will attend the new school when it opensI would have preferred our community to stay at DCES.NothingThe attempt to keep larger sections of the neighborhood togethernanThe Meadows should not be split from the rest of Lake Linganore. I've heard about an option that would move the meadows back but not the new Hamptons. Our children have already formed tight bonds with all
the areas of LL and should not be split up.nan-This is my least favorite option because it moves more neighborhoods to The New east county elementary and will bring some more kids from other areas overcrowding it from the start, even though this area has  the highest amount of new development being built around so leaving not much room for growth and adding kids from west winds area (they don't want to move from New Market elem) and from Liberty which I guess don't want to move either. Kids need stability and making these moved the least traumatic for
them would be best.With respect to the impact to the Lake LInganore Community, I like Elementary School Options A and B.It keeps the neighborhood that I currently live in (lake linganore meadows) in the new east county school
districtNothing.its closer location to our neighborhoodIt keeps our neighborhood together and our kids will share the same friends in classes and not have to start
over.NothingI'm not in favor of splitting the existing Lake Linganore community.  For the reasons stated above.A and B place is at the same school.Does not affect meYesKeeps the same kids from New Market MS to New Market HSIt keeps my family in our home school & it does a better job at keeping neighborhoods together.Keep Lake Linganore togetherIt keeps ALL of Lake Linganore together in two school (Blue Heron and Deer Crossing).This is not a good DRAFT for our community.it is ok but adds more people from different communities that may not want to move into our feeder like
west windsI don't like it.My son will be going to the new elementary school in either proposal so I don't have a preference either
way.everyone stays togetherBoth option A and B have my children attending the new East County  Elementary School which is closer to
our house and our community, this great for my children to remain connected with children in close to usIt alleviates crowding at DCES by moving some students to the new BHESNo opinionClass size decompressionBoth Elementary drafts look fineBalmoral and the Meadows (PB154, 157, and 159) have an average of 100 students at each school level. That is a very small amount of students to move from the greater Lake Linganore community. Lake Linganore is  a well connected community both physically and socially through trails that connect our neighborhood and community events. We feel that the small amount of students pulled into the LHS feeder would isolate these
students socially from the greater community.It will alleviate the current overcrowding of Deer Crossing Elementary.Preserves feeder patternAll schools below 100% Utilization except for Liberty ES.this is a fine option for Hampton's east/west since there's no one there to be affected. Leave meadows and
balmoral together with the rest of LLA.Both options put us in new Elementary school so I am indifferentNonei don't like this option.-I think it's best for the childrenNothingNothing.It keeps the meadows and balmoral together. We are a small community in every way  and much closer to
Oakdale.Reduces crowding in schoolsWe like both options for elementary schoolReducing the overcrowding in DCES and keeping the neighborhoods relatively together with the new
school (Blue Heron)The allocation of neighborhoods/students among the new East County elementary and Deer Crossing is
appropriate.I like that Option B allows PB 177 to attend East County ES instead of Liberty ES, as the distance to Liberty
ES for this planning block is excessive.I don't like that it puts Meadows and Balmoral in the LHS feederBreaking up the Meadows and Balmoral into the LHS feeder seems short sighted.Nothing unless it stays with OHS, my son is a minority and his friends would go to OHS in either option.
I'm already worried about him having friends and not getting harassed.don't like itSeveral Lake Linganore villages move together to the new East County elementary school.  You are not isolating a small number of students in just a few planning blocks as propose in the middle and high school
levels of option B.
