Nothing.  My daughter is at Oakdale and would have to change schools for 5th grade and again for 6th
grade.the students stay in the same middle and high schoolMore even balance of utilization across the schools.Frankly, I don't like A or B because they redistrict my location to SRESOakdale doesn't seem to be impacted too much, so we like that.NothingI like that it keeps PB63 in Oakdale ES, MS and HS. This is the current alignment which makes most sense as
we are the closes established neighborhood to all three schools.Same as above.Keeps our youngest with existing friends and school communityThe pyramid program will be moved from SRESI guess it's fine that all of the kids from Spring Ridge will now go to the same schoolThat PB #63 remains in the Oakdale feederI don'tAs residents Meadows LLA, we would prefer to remain with the other established LLA villages (with the exception of West Winds, which due to its proximity to LHS is currently and would remain in the LHS
feeder). Please move Meadows and Balmoral back into the OMS/OHS feeder under Option B.Keeps us at oakdale highSame feeder school for my areaSee previous response.I like that all of Spring Ridge attends togethernothingsame as ANothingDoes not affect meDislike - you will switch my child who attends Oakdale ES to Spring Ridge ES and split up neighborhood
againnice to have spring ridge together and have attendance at SRES not over capacityI would like Option B to keep all Spring Ridge kids in neighborhood at the same school.Oakdale is close proximityZeroNothingNothing, what happened to option 3?Same as aboveKeeps our neighborhood togetherThe attendance stays down at OHS.My neighborhood stays in the current feeder pattern.keeping neighborhoods togetherThat we are staying in Oakdale FeederI do not see any different in option a and b for oakdale elementary schoolMy children would maintain consistency in the Oakdale feeder pattern.Spring Ridge is the option for SR residentsI like that our neighborhood kids in Greenview will go to Oakdale for elementary.Keeps Spring Ridge together and lowers the attendance rate by moving the pyramid program.A and B are the same for us given our planning block (1).   Because of our planning block (1) we have absolutely no options to choose from.While we currently attend Oakdale ES and love it, we think it make
sense to keep the Spring Ridge community attending the same elementary school.A and B are the same for us.   It makes sense to keep the Spring Ridge community attending the same
elementary school.It is virtually the same as Option A
