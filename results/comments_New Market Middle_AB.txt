I live in Westwinds.  I want my kids to go to New Market Middle.  It is the closest school to my house and most convenient.  Thanks for making this the only option.  Oakdale MS is positioned in such a way that
many other neighborhoods make more sense to go to Oakdale.NODoesn't effect usMiddle school option B, students in Mount Airy should not have to go that far to Windsor knolls and
should be at new market msWest winds should go to NMMSNoNMMS is a great school, I've already had two children go through.  With both options our West Winds
neighborhood continues to go there.  It's also the closest in proximity to our home.Some of the newer schools also have newer/better facilities and it would be great if there were plans in
place to update some of the older schools like NMMS...There is too much on the interactive map for me to clearly understand what will take place with my kids.
Parents need a less complicated version. I tried to search by my address but was unable to enter it.Either option is fine.Yes to Option A. No to Option B. See above.Please adhere to your redistricting criteria.noWith youth sports programs and other activities that cross middle school borders, I'd be less concerned
about split middle school feeder patterns.Please do no re-district West Winds againI think Option A is the better one.  Students at Windser Knolls would be too spread out around the county
for option B.Don't like LHS has 3 separate MS feeders with Option A.Not at this timeThank you for listening to our neighborhood's previous comments and incorporating them into your final
two options
