I don't like how divisive both options seem within the neighborhoods.nanExcited about the new school!nanKeep A for the meadows and balmoral residents to stay with friends they have in linganore community!!!nanI prefer option A because it will keep the majority of our community together.nanOption A keeps the neighborhood with their childhood friends.Option B please!!!! Even if it impacts more kids, it's better for school capacity across the board.Option A keeps the Eaglehead at Linganore boundaries intact.  The new elementary school is within the
Eaglehead PUD so it makes sense that neighborhoods within the development would attend this school.NoPrefer Option ANoAnanLinganore is such a united community.  We love seeing our school friends at the lake and pools.  Separating
the community will upset everyone for sure.NoNono commentI recognize that LLA is too large to keep together in this redistricting, but it is important that one or two
communities not be isolated from the restPrefer aOur children would not drive past an elementary school to get to another with this plan.NonanDraft B makes sense. To send the Meadows and Balmoral to New Market ES/MS and Linganore HS and Pinehurst and Wodridge to Oakdale district doesn't seem right. The Meadows and Balmoral villages is a tiny portion of Lake Linganore and shouldn't affect the school population. Lake Linganore should stay together.
In order for Meadows students to drive to New Market Elementary/Middle Schools they literally pass Pinehurst Village (an Oakdale district portion of Lake Linganore in plan B) and DeerCrossing (an Oakdale district school in plan B) to get to school.  Oakdale MS is closer to to the Meadows and Balmoral then New Market ES/MS. So how in the world does that make sense.
Also before there were 3 options, now only 2. What is going on?
Please just make a decision so we have time to move if plan B is chosen. We have invested too much time
with teachers and coaches at Oakdale HS/MS to move to Linganore HS. Do the right thing and keep Lake Linganore Students together.Stop over developing!!!Option a is the better choice.It seems like the folks who are making these options are looking at maps and listening only to the most
vocal complainers when compiling new options rather than any type of beneficial analysis.NoWe were here first and this should be grandfathered into the original plans that were told to us when we
purchased.new properties should be part of new feeders and told that before buying.nanNopeKeep the kids at Deer CrossingOption A: Would like to see our kids continue in the same schools as their friends that they play sports with,
spend summers with and build relationships with.NonenanWe are all trying to keep our kids and our community together. Stability is important for children and they
older they get the more change disrupts that stability.no, i would prefer option aNo.looks goodnanNoOur kids will attend the new ES in both options.  I'm fine with either.Although the 2028 capacity numbers exceed 100% for 5 schools, Option B has smaller percentages of
overcapacity than option AA& B are the same for usNoIt is the same as Option A for our LL neighborhood, which is really what I'm focusing on.N/A.like A not B for MS and HSThe West Winds village of Lake Linganore (PB146) is currently in the Linganore Feeder and wants to stay
there, so option A may be preferable for them. Even though they are a village of Lake Linganore, they have their own board and operate independently in some manners from the rest of Lake LinganoreDraft A handles the overcrowding at the elementary school level without rocking the boat as much.Both option send students attending DCES to the new ECES (this is a good thing).I'm largely concerned about the Middle School split at the East County Elem School under Option B.I don't like splitting communities.NoGreat layouts, either is a good solution.-Option b is not a good answernanUnsureUnsure-nanDisappointed that children still in elementary school at Deer Crossing will be moved from their friends to a new Elementary School (many who have been with the same children since kindergarten). While I appreciate the effort to try and keep a majority of the neighborhood together, it would be nice if the entire neighborhood (Lake Linganore, or even Eaglehead section as a whole) together. I understand this is not always possible, it just adds in a seemingly unnecessary transition for these kids. I am happy to see that in Option A these children will continue to the same Middle School. I do not like that this does not happen in
Option B.nanThe Meadows should not be split from the rest of Lake Linganore. I've heard about an option that would move the meadows back but not the new Hamptons. Our children have already formed tight bonds with all
the areas of LL and should not be split upnan-Option A is the best optionnanNoNo thanks.The children in the Lake Linganore community will be split up from their close neighborhoods and that is
not good.NoKeep meadows with the rest of linganoreI am very concerned about the safety of non transport students. Meadows is very close to the new school  but our neighborhood roads are unsafe for elementary school kids to walk to school on. Just last month a car sideswiped another car so hard it flipped and took out power to a portion of the neighborhood. There are no
sidewalks and the roads are very narrow.nanIt's very important to keep the kids that are in MS to go to the same HS as their neighborsI felt that the option B was the better choice.  It really take the neighborhoods in account and keeps
neighbors together better.Keep Lake Linganore together as a community.In both option A and option B our specific village of lake linganore is going to the new Blue Heron ES.  I am
hopeful that this will be an equivalent school both in quality of the teachers and curriculum.I strongly feel DRAFT Option A is a better option for the Lake Linganore community. DRAFT B separates our connected community. I feel a better option would be to place the Meadows and Balmoral back into the OMS/OHS feeder pattern. Please creat a DRAFT B where the Meadows and Balmoral continue in the
OMS/OHS feeder pattern.We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows, planning blocks 154,157,159 be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances â€œout yearâ€ù overcapacity rates between LHS and OHS under this option. Reasons why:
Capacity and School Utilization Numbers:
o Balmoral and the Meadows have an average of 100 students at each school level. That is a very small amount of students to move from the greater Lake Linganore community. Lake Linganore is a well connected community both physically and socially through trails that connect our neighborhood and community events. We feel that the small amount of students pulled into the LHS feeder would isolate these students socially from the greater community.
o Under Option B, moving Balmoral and the Meadows to the LHS feeder has little impact on capacity numbers at all school levels (less than 1 percent). In fact, moving us back to the OMS/OHS feeder under Option B would create a more balanced out year utilization rate at both the middle and high school levels. Redistricting Criteria:
o Per Policy 200.2, the Board set criteria for redistricting that is intended to guide the final decision. During the January voting, community members choose their top three criteria as priorities for consideration. Two of those criteria were Impact on Neighborhoods and Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. Moving us out of the OHS feeder goes against the criteria of maintaining existing feeders and would negatively impact our neighborhood and community by socially isolating a small number of students from their peers in the larger community.
o Our neighborhood was redistricted from LHS into OHS just 8 years ago. It seems due to our location, we could be in a situation of continually flip flopping between feeders as additional schools are built. The Board's criteria also includes keeping redistricting to a minimum.
Split Feeders:
o It was clear from the March survey that parents prefer to avoid split feeders. Option B creates a split feeder at the elementary level. Additionally, a desire to have an even split moving from one school level to the next is not part of the overall redistricting criteria set forth by the Board and should not take priority over other factors when making a decision to alter an existing feeder pattern.
o Moving us into the NMMS/LHS feeder simply to achieve a 50/50 elementary to middle school split in the near term is not a sound reason to make a drastic change for these students. Hamptons West has yet to be built and could easily provide a better split balance as the homes are developed. As projection numbers are not always correct, trying to achieve a short term balance may result in a long-term imbalance as projection numbers have been incorrect in the past.
o Lastly, the Lake Linganore Village of Woodridge had the March Option B (redistricted to GTJMS) removed from consideration as a result of their vocal petition despite the low utilization rate of GTJMS under both of the current options. Clearly indicating that even splits and capacity utilization are a lower priority compared to Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. As our recommendation does not create an over capacity situation in either option, we should be afforded the same consideration in
order to remain at OMS and OHS.Please keep the Balmoral and Meadows Area of Lake Linganore with the rest of Lake LinganoreB is a bad choice because it messes with the Oakdale middle and high districting, which I'd like to see stay
the samenanNoNoBalmoral and the Meadows (PB154, 157, and 159) have an average of 100 students at each school level. That is a very small amount of students to move from the greater Lake Linganore community. Lake Linganore is  a well connected community both physically and socially through trails that connect our neighborhood and community events. We feel that the small amount of students pulled into the LHS feeder would isolate these
students socially from the greater community.I like Option A the best.The elementary students in the meadows and balmoral of Lake Linganore would not be walkers. The
neighborhood is not supplied with sidewalks. The roads are dangerous to walkers.Noneoption B pulls in kids to the the east county elementary school who then do not remain with their peers
through middle and high school.-Option B almost completely separates the Meadows and Balmoral from their current school community. I'm not opposed to Option B as long as those neighborhoods get switched back to Oakdale MS and Oakdale HS. Having children separated from half of their community at that pre teen age is very jarring and
unnecessary.I want BOption A would help as the new community is being built around the Elementary School. The new families would know that their kids are in a Linganore Feeder Pattern. This would give them an opportunity to create bonds with fellow LL families in both feeder patterns, cause a better split at the elementary level
without splitting the rest of the community.What I do not like about Option B is that it is based on "even splits". In terms of priorities, an "even school split" is not listed in Policy 200.2 as a criteria for consideration. Moving a small number of students (roughly 100 at the elementary, middle, and high school levels) into a new high school feeder pattern simply to  satisfy a 50/50 elementary to middle school split is not a criterion of Board Policy 200.2 and also runs
counter to the wishes of the community.My observation is that the development of lake Linganore and the surrounding area is a challenge to say the
least. By keeping the feeding pattern the same causes the least amount of disruption.If I am reading correctly my son will be attending a new school after only one year in Kindergarten in both
options which does not seem optimal, but if Deer Crossing is overcrowded I am not sure it can be avoided.My response to each option is the same: It is important to keep kids in the same feeder for all three levels of ES, MS, HS. Looking at the maps, I am thinking Option B keeps more of the kids together for all 3 levels.
Option B will also prevent overcrowding at Oakdale High and Oakdale Middle, especially as the
developments near those schools continue to grow.nanThese two options would have a positive impact on the area communities, keeping students at schools close
to where they live and alleviating overcrowding at Deer Crossing.I like that it keeps the Meadows and Balmoral in the OHS feederIt is fineYou need to keep them both in OHS, I live in Meadows and my son is a minority and has already been threatened on a playground in the meadows 3 separate times.  I worry about him going to a HS where his
main friends are not.
