Windsor Knolls (the community) should not have their kids sent to Urbana Elementary.  It's too far away, and there's still ample room at Kemptown.  Urbana Elem. will be at or above capacity in probably two years
anyhow.ONLY SUPPORT OPTION BB would be best for our neighborhoodYes, it doesn't make sense for the Windsor Knolls community to be bused to the new Urbana elementary school for the following reasons:  The distance to/from school, the time it will take to go to/from school, the distance is 3 miles vs 8 miles (in traffic within Urbana could be 20 minutes).  In addition, Kemptown is not
at capacity, so it would make sense to keep the 100  or less children within the Kemptown school district.The northern part of the current Kemptown district if redistricted to Twin Ridge should then also go to Linganore. To have them go to Twin Ridge, but to Urbana high makes no sense.  It also doesn't make sense to redistrict the  Windsor Knolls neighborhood to Urbana elementary. UES is farther away and the children will then be split from almost all the other UES students to go to WKMS only to meet back up in high
school.   Keep the Windsor Knolls neighborhood at Kemptown.Option A makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE for the residents of Windsor Knolls with elementary school- aged children. It is actually insulting to me that the creation of new, higher-density neighborhoods (under the permission of the county) would force my family, who chose to live in Windsor Knolls in large part because we wanted our children to attend KES, to send our child on a significantly longer bus ride every
day. Windsor Knolls has a long-standing connection to KES, and I think that it is unacceptable to sever that connection in order to balance things out for newer, higher-volume communities.I like Option A because my son stays at his current elementary school. In Option B he has to move to a
different elementary school and would not even go to HS with any of those kidsWhen an elected body treats its stakeholders (families) with contempt, disregards their concerns and input, and deprives them of a voice, the only way forward will be for legal recourse against FCPS and this anti- American and undemocratic redistricting plan. We live in Windsor Knolls. All of my 4 kids go or have gone or will go to Kemptown elementary. We are an integral part of that elementary school community and moved from Urbana to be in the KES school district. Do not send out kids to Urbana elementary schools. An option to avoid proceedings could be to allow families a choice as to a) remain as they are or b) accept an
invitation to consider a change in schools.I like option AI am happy with either as it doesn't change anythingNone of these options are good for KES. KES has stable enrollment at or near capacity, evenly spaced geographic distribution around the school, and the district has manageable growth. Both options disrupt KES to be a billpayer for other districts. Keeping PB 179 in KES would create a consistent feeder pattern for
the whole ES district throughout K-12.B is way betterOption A makes no sense for the people living in PB29.  There are 95 kids in this planning block.  If you
leave them at Kemptown, it is still not at capacity.  So why move them???I would like the windsor knolls neighborhood to stay in the Kemptown elementary school as it has
historically  been, because it's closer for young childrenOption B will essentially outcast our neighborhood from the rest of the community. We will be the only group that gets removed from Kemptown and moved to Twin Ridge. We could also be the only group from Twin Ridge that goes to Urbana. I thought the goal was to try and keep the feeder paths together but any
friends she makes in Elementary school would go to a different high school.Please keep planning blocks 179, 29, and 167 at Kemptown.I think this is the best fit for the redistricting.  Many of the complaints I've seen online and heard about revolve around short term impacts such as "this is our school" and don't take the long term impacts into
account.I like that my 3rd child will stay at an elementary school that his older brothers and sisters attended. We
have established relations and trust this staff.B we want our kids togetherThe Windsor Knolls community should have our kids go to Kemptown Elementary school.  Looking at the projections, Urbana Elem. will be overcrowded in two years and Kemptown will be way under-utilized.
Why not keep our kids at Kemptown if they're just going to have to go back next time FCPS redistricts?KES has an active PTA and many parent volunteers. I think we should do whatever we can to maintain it.I'm advocating for KES to stay together K - 12.Either option should include a remodel or addition to Kemptown before 2028. It's already at 102% and growing and there are no plans to remodel in the next 10 years (according to the 10-yr structure plan posted
online). Kemptown and Green Valley BOTH need to be on the remodel/new construction list!Option B is a better option because of the age demographic in that area.. it affects less kids.We prefer option BWe are PB 179 and option B would send us to Twin Ridge Elementary.  Doing this will not only separate us from our current Kemptown family but would also isolate my children from others whom they have gone to school with for years.  Our PB 179 has 38 children with no planned development.  This is a very small group of kids and I wouldn't think this would make a huge difference if we kept our zone as Kemptown Elementary.  Furthermore, sending us to Twin Ridge would not only separate us from our elementary  family but also again when option B has us going to Urbana High.  It looks as though we are the ONLY planning block that would be going to Urbana High from Twin Ridge Elementary.  Most of Twin Ridge Elementary will go to Linganore High isolating my kids again when everyone outside of my community  will go to a different high school.  Option B also isolates us from PB 9.  We have been zoned with PB 9 since we have lived in my community.  This is also the 1st time I have seen PB 179 having separate options that
PB 9 through this entire redistricting process.Option A does nothing for the kids of PB29 except put them on buses early in the morning and have them
arrive back home later in the afternoon.  Oh, also it probably balances new Urbana for two years until it gets overcrowded.Urbana is a good school but doesn't make since as an option for the Windsor Knolls community.  It is the 4th furthest elementary school from the community (Kemptown, Green Valley, and Centerville are all closer)  To bus children to Urbana sounds a little crazy.  The school will open not at capacity but the development continues, so will be over capacity with outside portables within the next (5) years. The
children will have to change back schools thenWith option A my children will have a 20 minute longer ride to and from school and our current before and
after school provider does not bus to the changes elementary schools.If option A is chosen, Kemptown will be under capacity by more than 100 students.  Meanwhile, in two years Urbana will be over capacity.  Why on earth would you bus kids from PB29 ten miles to an overcrowded school?  When redistricting is done again, our kids will just go back to Kemptown, meaning
I'll have one kid in Kemptown and one finishing up at Urbana.  That's ridiculous.There are 95 k-5 students in PB29.  Option A has them going to Urbana, which will be over capactiy in two years.  Option A has Kemptown under capacity by MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN OUR
PLANNING BLOCK!Both plans seen to ignore  future development.Option A reduces Kemptown Elementary School (KES) Enrollment by 31% and moves 126 children from 2 neighborhoods (PB29 and PB167) to Urbana Elementary School (UES) which equates to 21 children per grade (or essentially one classroom per grade).  This will cause classroom sizes to dramatically increase at KES.  Additionally, UES is projected to be at 102% capacity one year (2020 school year) after the redistricting is complete.  Moving PB29 and PB167 is irresponsible with the expected growth in the UES district (136 undeveloped lots; 251 projected elementary students).  KES has no projected development and would better accommodate PB29 and PB167 to allow for growth at UES.
In Option A:  Per the FCPS 2019 Projected Enrollment, Kemptown Elementary School is projected to have 422 students enrolled.  Redistricting PB29 and PB167 to UES would remove 126 students from KES. Assuming equal distribution, that is approximately 21 children per grade (K-5) removed from KES.  For 1st grade current enrollment is 49 students. Future enrollment projection estimates a growth of 5 students, though this class size has remained at 49 students for 2 years now (Kindergarten and 1st grade).  Removing 21 students creates a class size of 33 students.  This is highly detrimental to their learning, as large class sizes is what we are trying to avoid in redistricting in the first place.  While this grade level example assumes equal division among grades with the removal of 126 KES students under Option A of the current proposal, it is possible that some grades may lose more children than others causing disproportionate class sizes.
In Option A, moving PB29 and PB167 to UES from KES is a grave mistake.  The projected 2020 enrollment at UES is 102%, one year after redistricting.  Moreover, the projected 2028 enrollment at 115%.  This escalation will likely result in future redistricting as the growth in the Urbana area increases.
Conversely, the projected enrollment at KES with its current 2018-2019 boundary remains below 91% into 2028 with projected enrollment from the June 2018 EFMP Study.  It is unclear why the drastic enrollment projection numbers were updated in the June 2019 EFMP Study, with no planned or future developments in the KES boundary and only 13 undeveloped single-family lots currently available.  The June 2019 EFMP predicts an additional 100 students over the course of the next ten years, while the 2018 EFMP Study predicts stead enrollment at or under the SRC for KES.  The KES enrollment averages between 70-80% over the course of 10 years with no steady or extreme growth with the current boundary in place (2018 EFMP Study).  There is no publicly documented proof, or explanation of the moderate to large growth the 2019 EFMP predicts in the KES district.
Option A does not provide KES students proximity to UES, the school to which they would be newly redistricted under Option A. In addition, the lack of proximity to UES creates more problems: earlier start times for KES students and longer bus runs.
The distance between Kemptown Elementary and PB29 and PB167 is approximately 4 miles, while the distance between PB29 and PB 167 and Urbana Elementary is 12 miles.  Elementary students (as young as 5) riding the bus would be required to start their day earlier.  Currently, the students are picked up at 8:15 a.m. The closest Urbana Elementary bus stop is currently on Fire Tower Lane (15 minutes from PB29), and their bus pickup is currently at 8:09 am. It is likely a bus pickup for PB29 would be close to 7:40 a.m. for elementary students (which is the time many middle school students in PB29 are walking to school).  In the winter, it is not light at 7:40 am, and this time much earlier than PB29s current bus pickup.  Placing elementary school children in the dark and at a middle school hour is irresponsible.  The early hour places KES students at another disadvantage to their new UES peers and undermines an equitable learning opportunity, as most will have been on the bus for more than double the time than if they had been permitted to stay at their neighborhood school. The run time and distance of busses would be greatly increased with this position, as Urbana Elementary school is the furthest elementary school in the Urbana High School feeder pattern from PB29.
Both Options lead to double split feeder patterns for PB29, PB167, and PB179.  In Option A, PB29 and PB167 split from elementary school (66% of the children split; socially isolating them from their peers) to middle school at WKMS, and then from WKMS between UHS and LHS.  In Option B, PB176 is the only UHS neighborhood to attend TRES.  From there TRES splits between NMMS and WKMS, then from WKMS to LHS and UHS.  This goes against the BOE policy 200 for limiting the number of splits within a given feeder pattern, and isolates the double splits to three PBs (PB29 and PB167 in Option A; PB179 in Option B).  It appears that PB29 and PB167 are being used as pawns to balance out the elementary to middle school feeder pattern split at the disadvantage of our children
In Option B:  If we follow PB179 (38 elementary students) all the way through the plan, they are taking them out of KES to send them to TRES, an unnecessary move. Then, it moves KES and TRES students to WKMS, and finally when it goes to HS, only PB179 from TRES will go to UHS; the rest of TRES will go to LHS.  Using a grade level example there would be 6 kids that we move to TRES; they go to WKMS (this is the same as if they just stay in KES), and then those 6 kids leave everyone in TRES to go to UHS. This impact is higher for kids who never started at KES, for they would be leaving the kids they've gone to school with for 9 years to go to a HS with kids they've only known for 3 years. If we leave them in with KES, they would stay with the same kids all the way through ES, MS, and HS.Urbana Elementary is projected to be over capacity in two years and Kemptown will be under-utilized for at
least five in option A.  Keeping the kids from PB29 in Kemptown makes the most sense.Option A reduces Kemptown Elementary School (KES) Enrollment by 31% and moves 126 children from 2 neighborhoods (PB29 and PB167) to Urbana Elementary School (UES) which equates to 21 children per grade (or essentially one classroom per grade).

Moving students from KES to Urbana just does not make sense when considering the growth Urbana is, and
will continue to, experience.Would like to keep Kemptown togetherOption A does not make any sense to the anticipated growth in Urbana and goes against FCPS BOE policy

Meanwhile, Kemptown will be at ~66% capacity.  Why on earth would you take the 95 kids from PB29 and put them into an overcrowded
school when there is room closer to where they live?  Option B is the sensible choice.Option A reduces Kemptown Elementary School (KES) Enrollment by 31% and moves 126 children from 2 neighborhoods (PB29 and PB167) to Urbana Elementary School (UES) which equates to 21 children per grade (or essentially one classroom per grade).

If we leave them in with KES, they would stay with the same kids all the way through ES, MS, and HS.Neither option is great because it removes chunks of current Kemptown kids for what appears to be no reason.  In option A you are removing kids and sending them past the next closest school (Green Valley), to a school 15 minutes away (Urbana) which is already in an overcrowded area.  Urbana is continuing to grow and it won't be long until it reaches capacity, especially if you send kids that don't even live there to the school.  In option B, you are removing kids and sending them to Twin Ridge which is at or near capacity, whereas Kemptown is not as close to capacity.  It doesn't seem to make sense to change the Kemptown
boundaries at all since there is very little growth in our area.Prefer option BAs a parent of children at Kemptown Elementary School (PB 179), it is very saddening to see the Manorwood neighborhood (PB179) separated from its original PB9 community.  Elementary School Option B will result in kids within the same planned community attending different schools.
Twin Ridge Elementary School is near or over 100% (98% for option B and 102% for option A) capacity for both options A and B whereas Kemptown is at 71%(A) or 93% (B).  It is unclear the value the Frederick County School District is gaining in moving a small percentage of children (option B-38 children) out of a school that is under capacity and to a school that is near or over capacity. This will adversely affect our children's learning and is highly disruptive to the impacted children and families, and this option completely isolates these 38 children.
If we follow PB179 (38 elementary students) all the way through the plan, they are taking them out of KES  to send them to TRES, an unnecessary move. Then, it moves KES and TRES students to WKMS, and finally when it goes to HS, only PB179 from TRES will go to UHS; the rest of TRES will go to LHS. Using a grade level example there would be 6 kids that we move to TRES; they go to WKMS (this is the same as if they just stay in KES), and then those 6 kids leave everyone in TRES to go to UHS. This impact is higher for kids who never started at KES, for they would be leaving the kids they've gone to school with for 9 years to go to a HS with kids they've only known for 3 years. If we leave them in with KES, they would stay with the same kids all the way through ES, MS, and HS.
We have proposed as a community (KES) an additional option which would create relief at both TRES and UES, while fully utilizing Kemptown Elementary School.  Our proposed option would leave the Kemptown Elementary School boundary the same as it is currently.  This will allow for growth at UES, allow for TRES to maintain utilization as it is now, and allows for full utilization within Kemptown Elementary School.It's all well and good for the Urbana villages parents to want their kids to go to the same school as the kids one street over and whatnot, but not at the expense of the kids from Kemptown who have travel five times as far to get to school.  That's insane.  They want their kids to go to the same school as the same village or whatever?  Spare me.  My kids shouldn't have to be bused ten + miles so their kids can have the same friends.  That's favoritism and utter crap.  Why should the kids from PB29 go to Urbana Elementary if it's going to be overcrowded in two years anyhow??? The next time redistricting comes up, PB29 is going to be
sent right back to Kemptown anyhow.Option A - Based on the utilization statistics, this option does not seem to benefit school capacity for either KES or UES.
Option B - PB 179 will be shifted to TRES, which causes a split in an established neighborhood and community.
Please keep the KES district boundary as it is currently!I understand the parents of the villages in Urbana like option A because it keeps their little neighborhoods together.  That's all well and good, but my kids and the others of PB29 will suffer for their gain.  I don't want my kids to have to get bused over an hour to an overcrowded school so someone else's community can stick
together.There doesn't seem a need to split up KES.  It is not overcrowded.  This community has been split up
enough and it is devastating to split this much.We need a new option for this KES community. neither is acceptable.I would like to have option B plus considered. This plan is the current plan B, but it leaves kemptown
elementary out of the redistricting. Kemptown should be left alone as it is already under utilized.I am heartbroken at these proposals for our schools children.  See above, I do not believe there is any benefit in either of the options for kemptown redistricting. Only detriment to our closeknit school family and overcrowding at the surrounding schools more than or at the same level as before.  Do not punish the kemptown family by splitting it up unnecessarily, draw new lines in the new neighborhoods with concentrated population as would make the most sense and keep those children growing up together
together still.Option A reduces Kemptown Elementary School (KES) Enrollment by 31% and moves 126 children from 2 neighborhoods (PB29 and PB167) to Urbana Elementary School (UES) which equates to 21 children per grade (or essentially one classroom per grade). This will cause classroom sizes to dramatically increase at KES. Additionally, UES is projected to be at 102% capacity one year (2020 school year) after the redistricting is complete. Moving PB29 and PB167 is irresponsible with the expected growth in the UES district (136 undeveloped lots; 251 projected elementary students). KES has no projected development and would better accommodate PB29 and PB167 to allow for growth at UES.
In Option A: Per the FCPS 2019 Projected Enrollment, Kemptown Elementary School is
projected to have 422 students enrolled. Redistricting PB29 and PB167 to UES would remove 126 students from KES. Assuming equal distribution, that is approximately 21 children per grade (K-5) removed from KES. For 1st grade current enrollment is 49 students. Future enrollment projection estimates a growth of 5 students, though this class size has remained at 49 students for 2 years now (Kindergarten and 1st grade). Removing 21 students creates a class size of 33 students. This is highly detrimental to their learning, as large class sizes is what we are trying to avoid in redistricting in the first place. While this grade level example assumes equal division among grades with the removal of 126 KES students under Option A of the current proposal, it is possible that some grades may lose more children than others causing disproportionate class sizes.
In Option A, moving PB29 and PB167 to UES from KES is a grave mistake. The projected 2020 enrollment at UES is 102%, one year after redistricting. Moreover, the projected 2028
enrollment at 115%. This escalation will likely result in future redistricting as the growth in the Urbana area increases. Conversely, the projected enrollment at KES with its current 2018-2019 boundary remains below 91% into 2028 with projected enrollment from the June 2018 EFMP Study. It is unclear why the drastic enrollment projection numbers were updated in the June 2019 EFMP Study, with no planned or future developments in the KES boundary and only 13 undeveloped single-family lots currently available. The June 2019 EFMP predicts an additional 100 students over the course of the next ten years, while the 2018 EFMP Study predicts stead enrollment at or under the SRC for KES. The KES enrollment averages between 70-80% over the course of 10 years with no steady
or extreme growth with the current boundary in place (2018 EFMP Study). There is no publicly documented proof, or explanation of the moderate to large growth the 2019 EFMP predicts in the KES district.
Option A does not provide KES students proximity to UES, the school to which they would be newly redistricted under Option A. In addition, the lack of proximity to UES creates more problems: earlier start times for KES students and longer bus runs.
The distance between Kemptown Elementary and PB29 and PB167 is approximately 4 miles, while the distance between PB29 and PB 167 and Urbana Elementary is 12 miles. Elementary students (as young as 5) riding the bus would be required to start their day earlier. Currently, the students are picked up at 8:15 a.m. The closest Urbana Elementary bus stop is currently on Fire Tower Lane (15 minutes from PB29), and their bus pickup is currently at 8:09 am. It is likely a bus pickup for PB29 would be close to 7:40 a.m. for elementary students (which is the time many middle school students in PB29 are walking to school). In the winter, it is not light at 7:40 am, and this time much earlier than PB29s current bus pickup. Placing elementary school children in the dark and at a middle school hour is irresponsible. The early hour places KES students at another disadvantage to their new UES peers and undermines an equitable learning opportunity, as most will have been on the bus for more than double the time than if they had been permitted to stay at their neighborhood school. The run time and distance of busses would be greatly increased with this position, as Urbana Elementary school is the furthest elementary school in the Urbana High School feeder pattern from PB29.
Both Options lead to double split feeder patterns for PB29, PB167, and PB179. In Option A, PB29 and PB167 split from elementary school (66% of the children split; socially isolating them from their peers) to middle school at WKMS, and then from WKMS between UHS and LHS. In Option B, PB176 is the only UHS neighborhood to attend TRES. From there TRES splits between NMMS and WKMS, then from WKMS to LHS and UHS. This goes against the BOE policy 200 for limiting the number of splits within
a given feeder pattern, and isolates the double splits to three PBs (PB29 and PB167 in Option A; PB179 in Option B). It appears that PB29 and PB167 are being used as pawns to balance out the elementary to middle school feeder pattern split at the disadvantage of our children
In Option B: If we follow PB179 (38 elementary students) all the way through the plan, they are taking them out of KES to send them to TRES, an unnecessary move. Then, it moves KES and TRES students to WKMS, and finally when it goes to HS, only PB179 from TRES will go to UHS; the rest of TRES will go to LHS. Using a grade level example there would be 6 kids that we move to TRES; they go to WKMS (this is the same as if they just stay in KES), and then those 6 kids leave everyone in TRES to go to UHS. This impact is higher for kids who never started at KES, for they would be leaving the kids they've gone to school with for 9 years to go to a HS with kids they've only known for 3 years. If we leave them in with KES, they would stay with the same kids all the way through ES, MS, and HS. It is not believed there has been any justification that the benefit of moving children from the current Kemptown Elementary School District
outweighs the cost to our children and community in either of these options.Yes, I am in favor of option B with the exception of the removing the small number of kemptown kids to twin ridge. There isn't enough substantiated growth to move any kids from kemptown and it will separate friends and neighborhoods. Please leave the kemptown district alone, don't fix something that isn't broken! Kemptown is currently underutilized and you could use the space at twin ridge to provide relief for new
market or Oakdale.Why would you remove nearly 30% of the student population of Kemptown to populate a school that is three times as far away and will be overcrowded in a couple of years?  Option A is ridiculous for the
Kemptown area.Draft Option A unnecessarily pulls 1/3 of the current enrollment from Kemptown to attend Urbana Elm. Kemptown is currently not overcapacity, and the projected capacity is only 101-102% in the 1-5 year projections (this is 4-6 students, or 1 per student per grade).   Furthermore, no new growth is planned for the Kemptown area, with only 13 undeveloped lots existing in the area. By pulling over 100 students from Kemptown to attend Urbana, Kemptown would be vastly underutilized, and would most likely have to reduce teaching staff and have higher class sizes (up to 30 students).  THIS MAKES NO SENSE.  The town  of Urbana has hundreds of undeveloped lots, and Urbana Elm is extremely likely to reach capacity of 100% and higher WITHOUT the current Kemptown students moving to the school.  I don't understand why our children will be moved from their community and friends when it does NOT solve the capacity problem?
Draft Option B is a much better option, for the most part keeping the Kemptown community whole.
However, it really doesn't seem just to move only 30 students out of the school, when it is going to have a negligible impact on capacity numbers at Kemptown or Twin Ridge.Our original planning block (designed with the intent of keeping communities together) was split with our Manorwood Neighbors staying in KES and the Sam Hill neighbors being forced out to TRES. There does not seem to be any benefit to either school as it takes 30 kids from a school that is slightly over capacity to another school which pushes it to the same capacity level. It also creates a feeder pattern that completely isolates our neighborhood from the rest of Mount Airy/Windsor Knolls. Allowing these 30 kids to stay in KES would have minimal impact on the schools capacity while providing them a drastically improved
social structure going forward.Option A is basically playing favorites with the villages of Urbana, keeping their little enclave intact at the expense of the kids from Kemptown.  Taking kids from a school (Kemptown) that needs no relief and putting them on buses for 10+ miles is ridiculously unfair.  So what if the village people want their kids to go to one school or another; there are THREE available within a couple of miles!  Taking kids from Kemptown and placing them ten miles away at Urbana is grossly unfair!  We don't want our kids to have to
go out of district just so village families can be appeased.  That's bullsh*t.There is no reason to move any kids out of Kemptown. They are not at capacity and will not go overcapacity
in years. Keep Kemptown together.Kemptown Elementary should remain the way it is. Kemptown is not overcrowded and will not be. Urbana has hundreds of lots for houses to be built. Moving students from Kemptown to Urbana will only add to more overcrowding in a very populated, growing area of Urbana while Kemptown will not be fully utilized
and be under capacity.All  schools'  utilization is well balanced, which means less possibility for school redistricting  in the near
future. I hope this new boundary can last another 10 years, providing more certainty in FCPS.Pulling students from Kemptown makes no sense!Option A is a thinly-veiled show of favoritism to the villages of Urbana who seem to think their little communities are more deserving of going to the elementary of their choice than the kids at Kemptown, who would be forced to ride a bus three times as far to attend a school that will be overcrowded in two years.  It's utterly ridiculous that the villages should get to say which kids go to which schools at their convenience.
Kemptown Elementary needs no relief, and taking kids from their local school to populate Urbana is stupid.Option A reduces Kemptown Elementary School (KES) Enrollment by 31% and moves 126 children from 2 neighborhoods (Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven) to Urbana Elementary School (UES)
o 31% of KES equates to 21 children per grade, or essentially one classroom per grade
Projected growth within this part of the county does not align with redistricting children out of the KES boundary, especially to Urbana Elementary School
o Limited growth planned in the KES district (13 undeveloped lots; 6 projected additional elementary school children)
o Significant growth planned in UES district (136 undeveloped lots; 251 projected additional elementary school students)
o This option projects Urbana Elementary school at 102% capacity within a year of redistricting (2020 school year)
Estimated capacity for Urbana Elementary goes up to 115% by 2028.  Moving children from KES exasperates the need and frequency for redistricting this area and does not allow UES the room to grow it so desperately needs
Option A creates a double split feeder pattern for only 2 neighborhoods (Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven) o Children in these two neighborhoods will split from elementary school to middle school (between Windsor Knolls MS and Urbana MS)
66% of the children that split are from Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven to WKMS
o Children are then split again at the middle school to high school level from WKMS between Urbana High School and Linganore High School
Option B separated the Manorwood neighborhood into two planning blocks, which will result in kids within the same planned community at different schools for elementary schoolTwin Ridge is near or over 100% (98% for option B and 102% for option A) capacity for both options A and B whereas Kemptown is at 71%(A) or 93% (B).
o It is unclear the value the Frederick County School Districts is gaining in moving a small percentage of children (option B) out of a school that is under capacity and to a school that is near or over capacity.
o This will adversely affect our children's learning and is highly disruptive to the impacted children and families.
There is no justification that the benefit of moving children from the current Kemptown Elementary School District outweighs the cost to our children and community in either of these options.In Option A, moving PB29 and PB167 to UES from KES is a grave mistake.  The projected 2020 enrollment at UES is 102%, one year after redistricting.  Moreover, the projected 2028 enrollment at 115%.  This escalation will likely result in future redistricting as the growth in the Urbana area increases.
Option A redistricts 31% of the Kemptown Elementary population (PB29 and PB167) to Urbana Elementary, thereby isolating two Kemptown communities from the other 69% of Kemptown.  An additional split occurs in Option A when 32% of Urbana Elementary matriculates to WKMS, the majority (66%) being from PB29 and PB167.   It appears by the numbers that PB29 and PB167 are only moved into the UES boundary to balance the feeder split percentages between UMS and WKMS, which is not a justifiable reason to split 31% of elementary students from their current school and deplete the KES enrollment.
Option A creates an unnecessary and addition split of an elementary school pattern, uprooting 31% of the KES population 2 times between elementary school and middle school.  This redistricting proposal causes the students from PB29 and PB167 to be a virtual island, as they are separated from their peers once again. For some students, these two disruptive changes will occur within two years of each other, as PB29 and PB167 comprise two thirds of the students moving from UES to WKMS.
After middle school, some of these same students will face yet another split from their peers, as Option A sends 71% of WKMS students to Linganore HS and 29% to Urbana HS, while Option B sends 60% of WKMS students to Linganore HS and 40% to Urbana HS.
In summary, the Kemptown Community bears an unnecessary and undue redistricting burden under Option A. When one considers that the Kemptown community, which matriculates to WKMS, will be split between LHS and UHS, it is unjust to further split this community at the young elementary level as well. For, in Option A, some students will be plucked from Kemptown Elementary School (where some will have attended for four years) and redistricted to Urbana Elementary School; then, they are removed from the Urbana Community back to their former KES community at Windsor Knolls Middle, only to be split a third time between Linganore High School and Urbana High.  Optimally, the FCPS redistricting committee stated that they found two redistricting splits disruptive; the committee prefers no more than one split.  Option A is, thus, in direct contrast to the aims of the LOU Redistricting Committee  Option B better supports the  aims of the committee, for it affords a more sensible opportunity; in maintaining the current boundary for PB29 and PB167, it maintains only one split of the KES community at the high school level, permitting 100% of their elementary school to move to WKMS and ensuring feeder patterns are not excessively disrupted.
For Option B, Option B has PB179 at Twin Ridge Elementary, followed by Windsor Knolls Middle, and then Urbana High. This will socially isolate this planning block since all but PB179 at Twin Ridge will go to
Linganore.Option A creates a double split feeder pattern for only 2 neighborhoods (Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven) o Children in these two neighborhoods will split from elementary school to middle school (between Windsor Knolls MS and Urbana MS)
66% of the children that split are from Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven to WKMS.  It appears that the Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven Neighborhoods are being used as pawns to balance out the elementary to middle school feeder pattern split at the disadvantage of our children.
o Children are then split again at the middle school to high school level from WKMS between Urbana High School and Linganore High SchoolOption A doesn't really seem practical. In some cases kids will be attending elementary schools that are no where close to where they live; even though there are several elementary schools considerably closer to
where they live.The best option would be to keep Kemptown together. Breaking off 120 students or 38 students does not
seem to solve any issues with Kemptown Elementary.no commentsThe two option would split our neighborhood in half.Option A works in the UES area but creates issues in the Kemptown and Twin Ridge ES areas by shifting students and actually increasing TRES attendance over 100% capacity while decreasing attendance at KES. This seems counter intuitive to the mission of this redistricting study.  KES is already small in comparison to other FCPS elementary schools and it would seem a disadvantage to further decrease its size while
increasing another.Please leave the kemptown district alone. The school has empty classrooms, no children should be moved from there. If you redistricting the kemptown border my specials needs daughter will have to change
schools in first grade!Allowing Option A to be chosen is playing favorites and siding with the people of the villages of Urbana at the expense of the kids of Kemptown.  Option A would empty out Kemptown to 71% capacity.  Kemptown needs no relief, so pulling our kids to go to Urbana is just wrong.  Especially when is it predicted that Urbana will be over capacity in two years.  What will happen then?  You'll just send them back to
Kemptown!noOption A reduces Kemptown Elementary School (KES) Enrollment by 31% and moves 126 children from 2 neighborhoods (PB29 and PB167) to Urbana Elementary School (UES) which equates to 21 children per grade (or essentially one classroom per grade).  This will cause classroom sizes to dramatically increase outside of the state recommended levels at KES.  Additionally, UES is projected to be at 102% capacity one year (2020 school year) after the redistricting is complete.

It is not believed there has been any justification that the benefit of moving children from the current Kemptown Elementary School District outweighs the cost to our children and community in either of these
options.Option B is the perfect option across all school levels - ES through HS!Projected growth within this part of the county does not align with redistricting children out of the Kemptown boundary, especially to Urbana Elementary School. Kemptown should be left alone and kept as is. This option projects Urbana Elementary school at 102% capacity within a year of redistricting (2020 school year).

There is no publicly documented proof, or explanation of the moderate to large growth the 2019 EFMP predicts in the KES district.
As of the June 2019 EFMP report, there are 136 undeveloped lot in UES boundary and 13 in KES boundary. Future enrollment numbers per development (per Cropper GIS) are 6 elementary students in the KES boundary and 251 elementary students in the UES boundary.  This development will lead to significant growth expected within the UES boundary and adding PB29 and PB167 to the UES boundary will only exacerbate the problem and lead to future redistricting sooner.  PB29 and PB167 currently have 126 elementary school students within them.  This is a significant burden on the UES boundary.  Thus, moving students in PB29 (currently 96 students) from Kemptown Elementary is irresponsible in looking forward at future growth and school capacity needs.
Moving 2 planning blocks (PB29 and PB167) to UES adds to an already overcrowded school unnecessarily. This leads to the likelihood of large-scale redistricting in the near future as well as highly overcrowded schools.  However, leaving the KES boundary the way it is during the 2018-2019 academic year allows for the much-needed additional growth within the UES boundary, as shown in the projected enrollment data over the course of the next ten years.
Not moving PB29 and PB167 allows growth for UES without impacting capacity rates at KES.  The room these students would occupy would be better used for planned growth patterns, rather than the high probability they would be moved back and forth in the near future.  This would greatly impact our children (both the children at KES and UES) by increasing the number of times neighborhoods are redistricted, resulting in instability in neighborhoods and continued disruption of assigned feeder patterns.  Not only does moving children out of the current KES boundary do a great disservice to our children, but it would serve to exacerbate the problems this redistricting study is working so hard to resolve.
Proposed alternative (Option B+):  Keep the Kemptown Elementary School Boundary as it is currently.
This option would allow for a Urbana Elementary School to grow, as the Urbana community grows.  It would keep Twin Ridge Elementary from becoming further overcrowded.  Additionally, this proposal does not skeletonize Kemptown Elementary School.I don't understand why more portables and another AP couldn't be added to elementary schools in Urbana
for 2 years so kids aren't on busses longer or having to switch schools.Option B+ is leaving Kemptown Elementary as it currently is, keeping the school utilized well, as there are currently classrooms not in use even at 98% capacity this year.  There is not a lot of growth in the  Kemptown district, and it gives Urbana the ability to have room to grow, which it inevitably will.  There is so much growth in Urbana, and if you move the Windsor knolls/ Loch haven planning block like it is proposed in option A, it will only be worse.  It also makes bus rides two to three times longer for kids if they are moved to Urbana elementary, therefore possibly needing an additional bus to make sure kids get to
school on time.I am concerned that option A would under utilize KES and that by keeping the KES boundaries as is it opens available space for the rapidly growing Urbana area.  I do not like the thought of my children being
"bounced"ù around to different schools because of our location.Both seem to make some odd changes to the Kemptown populationLooking at the population growth projections, Urbana Elementary will be overcrowded by A LOT in the next few years *WITHOUT* the kids from Kemptown.  Meaning you'll just have to redistrict again and probably put them back at Kemptown.  Save yourself a step and leave Kemptown alone.  It is approaching capacity, but nowhere near the level Urbana is.  And the projected development in the Kemptown area is nothing compared to Urbana.  You'll just have to build another elementary school in the Urbana area sooner
rather than later.Current 5 year enrollment projections show Kemptown growing to 102% capacity (which only equates to 6 students, or 1 student per grade).  However, Option A reduces Kemptown Elementary School (KES) Enrollment by 31% and moves 126 children from 2 neighborhoods (Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven) to Urbana Elementary School (UES) 31% of KES equates to 21 children per grade, or essentially one classroom per grade.
o Projected growth within this part of the county does not align with redistricting children out of the KES boundary, especially to Urbana Elementary School
o Limited growth planned in the KES district (13 undeveloped lots; 6 projected additional elementary school children)
o Significant growth planned in UES district (136 undeveloped lots; 251 projected additional elementary school students)
o This option projects Urbana Elementary school at 102% capacity within a year of redistricting (2020 school year)
o Estimated capacity for Urbana Elementary goes up to 115% by 2028.  Moving children from KES exasperates the need and frequency for redistricting this area and does not allow UES the room to grow it so desperately needs
o Option A creates a double split feeder pattern for only 2 neighborhoods (Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven)
o Children in these two neighborhoods will split from elementary school to middle school (between Windsor Knolls MS and Urbana MS)
o 66% of the children that split are from Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven to WKMS
o Children are then split again at the middle school to high school level from WKMS between Urbana High School and Linganore High School
The difference between Option A and B is negligible for Urbana Elementary - a mere 3% difference in reduction for Urbana between the two options, whereas the difference between Option A and Option B for Kemptown Elementary is a startling 22% difference.  Why require KES to suffer a 31% reduction in plan A, when Urbana only gains a 3% relief?
Option A reduces Kemptown Elementary's Equated Enrollment from 102% to 71%. Option B reduces Kemptown's Equated Enrollment to 93%.
Option A reduces Urbana Elementary's Equated Enrollment from 103% to 91%. Option B reduces Urbana's Enrollment to 94% - a mere 3% difference.
In Option A Centerville ES does have 330 students moving to another school; however, it is important to note that the other two schools to which they are moving, Sugarloaf ES and Urbana ES, are both located in Urbana. All three schools are within a mile or a mile and a half from each other. Whereas, the other students affected by Option A (students from four other schools including Kemptown Elementary) would be redistricted to a different school not within their community. Unlike the student populations in Urbana they face the challenges of a of a new school, as well as a new community!
The distance between Kemptown Elementary and PB29 and PB167 is approximately 4 miles, while the distance between PB29 and PB 167 and Urbana Elementary is 12 miles.  From my home (PB 167), it takes 17 minutes to get to Urbana Elementary school.  Currently, it only take 7 minutes to get to Kemptown Elementary.  Elementary students (as young as 5) riding the bus would be required to start their day earlier. It is likely a bus pickup for PB167 would be close to 7:40 a.m. for elementary students (which is the time many middle school students in PB167 are walking to school).  In the winter, it is not light at 7:40 am, and this time much earlier than PB167 current bus pickup (8:25 currently).  Placing elementary school children in the dark and at a middle school hour is irresponsible.  The early hour places KES students at another disadvantage to their new UES peers and undermines an equitable learning opportunity, as most will have been on the bus for more than double the time than if they had been permitted to stay at their neighborhood school. The run time and distance of busses would be greatly increased with this position, as Urbana Elementary school is the furthest elementary school in the Urbana High School feeder pattern from PB167. A 17 minute commute to my children's school would present numerous challenges to me and my children.  If my child were hurt or sick, that would be 10 minutes longer to get to her school.  Should I be coming from work, (in Montgomery County), my commute up I-270 could be 30-45 minutes longer to UES than to KES, which is highly significant in an emergency or urgent situation.  When I volunteer, drop off forgotten items, or visit during the lunch hour, that adds up to an additional 45 minutes - 1 hour I would have to take leave
from my work.I have concerns about how the class numbers would be affected by the changes which could result in my children being in rooms with more children than may be needed.  I fear that the growth of the Urbana
housing is going to impact plan A more than anticipated.I have concerns about how the class numbers would be affected by the changes which could result in my children being in rooms with more children than may be needed.  I fear that the growth of the Urbana
housing is going to impact plan A more than anticipated.PB 29 and 167 should remain at Kemptown ES. Kemptown ES should remain the way it is in order to fully utilize the school and make sure these students are not subject to a double split feeder pattern and another redistricting in a couple years since Urbana ES will be over capacity the first year it opens while Kemptown
will be under capacity.It doesn't seem to make sense to pull students from Kemptown ES currently and send them to Urbana ES and to split them from their ES friends when some are sent to WKMS and some to UMS and then to have the same thing repeated when WKMS is split between LHS and UHS.  It would seem to make more sense as
in Option B to keep those kids at Kemptown where they would all feed into WKMS.Kemptown elementary shouldn't even be in the redistricting area.  Kemptown can offer no relief to other schools, nor does it need relief.  Busing our kids from PB29 twelve miles to Urbana elementary is ridiculous and shows blind favoritism to the villages of Urbana who cannot be inconvenienced by traveling perhaps an
additional half mile to school.The numbers at Kemptown ES should not decrease by over 100 students.  It is already a small school.  I believe this would then negatively impact the students by creating other issues, like split grades.  I do not want my children to be in classes that have 2 grades in them.  This would ultimately result in ineffective
delivery of curriculum to my children.  Bad impact on children.Option A shows favoritism to the villages of Urbana at the expense of the kids of Kemptown.  Leave
Kemptown alone.o Option A reduces Kemptown Elementary School (KES) Enrollment by 31% and moves 126 children from 2 neighborhoods (Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven) to Urbana Elementary School (UES)

Concerns with LOU Redistricting Options for the Kemptown Elementary School Communityâ€”Statistics and Evidence for our concern
With the new SRCs the utilization increases in every elementary school, which causes two new elementary schools to go over 100% utilization (Kemptown and Oakdale). Middle and High schools all go under 100%
utilization with the revised SRCs. The justification for moving 31% of the student population out ofPlease do not change the Kemptown community for the sake of change. From the data I have seen, there is no benefit for both/either option A and/or option B. The changes certainly do justify the negative impact.
Please keep PB 179, 29 and 167 at Kemptown. Please keep the Kemptown community together.ES Option A separates PB29 and 167 from the rest of Kemptown, creating multiples issues.  First,  Kemptown is not overcrowded and there is very limited growth planned in the area (13 undeveloped lots). However, Urbana ES, where Option A would bus us, has significant growth planned (136+ undeveloped lots).  Urbana ES's growth rate will increase greatly.  Therefore, it makes sense for both schools to leave PB29 and 167 at Kemptown.
Second, Option A creates a double split feeder pattern for these 2 neighborhoods.  Urbana ES splits between 2 middle schools and Windsor Knolls MS splits between 2 high schools.  This is very detrimental to
students' well being and is against the goals that were stated for redistricting.PLEASE consider allowing KES boundaries to stay the way they are now - allow the Urbana community to
grow, and keep our KES utilized to its ability instead of skeletonizing the school.Whatever ultimately happens, I think it's important to keep Kemptown students together K-12, whether
they land at UHS or LHS.As a proposed alternative, keep the Kemptown Elementary School Boundary as it is currently.
This option would allow for a Urbana Elementary School to grow, as the Urbana community grows.  It would keep Twin Ridge Elementary from becoming further overcrowded.  Additionally, this proposal does not skeletonize Kemptown Elementary School. This option would allow for all of the feeder patterns to only
have one split, while limiting overcrowding of heavily developed areas within this part of the county.A better option would be Option B+ that moves PB 43, 44, 45, and 53 to TRES instead of PB179 (keeping that instead at KES). With the current option B GVES will be over capacity when it opens in 2020 (105%) and increasing in it's overcapacity by 2025 (118%) and 2028 (115%). This mapping is more beneficial to GVES, KES, and TRES than the current plan and maintains the MS and HS alignments already planned for all three schools. There would be continuity for PB 43/44/45/53 from ES through HS in B+ plan, unlike what is planned for PB179 in the current option B where they are the only PB from their elementary school that is
not routed to LHS.Option A seems to be a better option for districting the new Urbana Elementary school. Makes sense from
both physical and fiscal perspectives. Although my current neighborhood (PB 29) would be affected, Option A provides better planning for the Urbana region in the future.Option A lets the villages of Urbana have deciding power in where their kids go while ignoring Kemptown's needs.  Having some little villages -as if they're special- attend one school and others a different one is stupid.  Option A pulls 29% of Kemptown's population away.  Urbana is going to be overcrowded in two years without the kids from Kemptown.  Why bus our kids to an overcrowded school
leaving another WAY underutilized?As a proposed alternative, keep the current Kemptown Elementary School Boundary in tact.
This option would allow for a Urbana Elementary School to grow, as the Urbana community grows.  It would keep Twin Ridge Elementary from becoming further overcrowded.  Additionally, this proposal does not skeletonize Kemptown Elementary School. This option would allow for all of the feeder patterns to only have one split, while limiting overcrowding of heavily developed areas within this part of the county. 1. Under Option A, nearly 1/3 of the school (PB29 and PB167) moved to Urbana Elementary School under Option A.  This not only isolates those two planning blocks, but it does a grave disservice to the KES community.  This move will lead to larger class sizes, less volunteers, a skeletonized school, diminished PTA support, and a significant disruption to our children and community.
By moving these two PBs (29 and 167), you are creating the burden of two splits in their feeder pattern to fall solely on these two areas (from ES to MS; then MS to HS).
In Option A:  Per the FCPS 2019 Projected Enrollment, Kemptown Elementary School is projected to have 422 students enrolled.  Redistricting PB29 and PB167 to UES would remove 126 students from KES. Assuming equal distribution, that is approximately 21 children per grade (K-5) removed from KES.  For 1st grade current enrollment is 49 students. Future enrollment projection estimates a growth of 5 students, though this class size has remained at 49 students for 2 years now (Kindergarten and 1st grade).  Removing 21 students creates a class size of 33 students.  This is highly detrimental to their learning, as large class sizes is what we are trying to avoid in redistricting in the first place.  While this grade level example assumes equal division among grades with the removal of 126 KES students under Option A of the current proposal, it is possible that some grades may lose more children than others causing disproportionate class sizes.

It is my understanding that the Villages of Urbana (VoU) community is rallying for Elementary School Option A due to the way that it keeps their community together.  In the attached document we propose an alternate option (arbitrarily named B+), which could benefit both the KES and VoU communities but adopting the VoU (Centerville, Sugarloaf, Urbana ES) pattern and distribution of children, while NOT moving PB29 and PB167 to UES, which would benefit the Kemptown Elementary School Community.  This proposal allows for future growth to occur in the Urbana area without adding to an overcrowding problem at UES.  It also allows for the full utilization of Kemptown Elementary School.
We have proposed as a community (KES) an additional option which would create relief at both TRES and UES, while fully utilizing Kemptown Elementary School.  Our proposed option would leave the Kemptown Elementary School boundary the same as it is currently.  This will allow for growth at UES, allow for TRES to maintain utilization as it is now, and allows for full utilization within Kemptown Elementary School.

We hope as a community you seriously take a look at our concerns for both Elementary School Option A and B and give some serious thought to the detriment that moving PB29 and PB167 causes to both the Urbana and Kemptown communities.
2. Under Option B Kemptown Elementary School, it is very saddening to see the Manorwood neighborhood (PB179) separated from its original PB9 community.  Elementary School Option B will result in kids within the same planned community attending different schools.
Twin Ridge Elementary School is near or over 100% (98% for option B and 102% for option A) capacity for both options A and B whereas Kemptown is at 71%(A) or 93% (B).  It is unclear the value the Frederick County School District is gaining in moving a small percentage of children (option B-38 children) out of a
school that is under capacity and to a school that is near or over capacity. This will adversely affect our children's learning and is highly disruptive to the impacted children and families, and this option
completely isolates these 38 children.
If we follow PB179 (38 elementary students) all the way through the plan, they are taking them out of KES  to send them to TRES, an unnecessary move. Then, it moves KES and TRES students to WKMS, and finally when it goes to HS, only PB179 from TRES will go to UHS; the rest of TRES will go to LHS. Using a grade level example there would be 6 kids that we move to TRES; they go to WKMS (this is the same as if they just stay in KES), and then those 6 kids leave everyone in TRES to go to UHS. This impact is higher for kids who never started at KES, for they would be leaving the kids they've gone to school with for 9 years to go to a HS with kids they've only known for 3 years. If we leave them in with KES, they would stay with the same kids all the way through ES, MS, and HS.

Our proposed option would leave the Kemptown Elementary School boundary the same as it is currently.  This will allow for growth at UES, allow for TRES to maintain utilization as it is now, and allows for full utilization within Kemptown Elementary School.

a) The yellow highlighted cells are the current class room needs at KES with the projected 2019 enrollmentAny way we can split the difference in kids and only reduce Kemptown by 50?Option A creates a double split feeder pattern for only 2 neighborhoods (Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven) o Children in these two neighborhoods will split from elementary school to middle school (between Windsor Knolls MS and Urbana MS)
o66% of the children that split are from Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven to WKMS
oIt appears that the Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven Neighborhoods are being used as pawns to balance out the elementary to middle school feeder pattern split at the disadvantage of our children.
o Children are then split again at the middle school to high school level from WKMS between Urbana High School and Linganore High School
In Option A, moving PB29 and PB167 to UES from KES is a grave mistake.  The projected 2020 enrollment at UES is 102%, one year after redistricting.  Moreover, the projected 2028 enrollment at 115%.  This escalation will likely result in future redistricting as the growth in the Urbana area increases.
Conversely, the projected enrollment at KES with its current 2018-2019 boundary remains below 91% into 2028 with projected enrollment from the June 2018 EFMP Study.  It is unclear why the drastic enrollment projection numbers were updated in the June 2019 EFMP Study, with no planned or future developments in the KES boundary and only 13 undeveloped single-family lots currently available.  The June 2019 EFMP predicts an additional 100 students over the course of the next ten years, while the 2018 EFMP Study predicts stead enrollment at or under the SRC for KES.  The KES enrollment averages between 70-80% over the course of 10 years with no steady or extreme growth with the current boundary in place (2018 EFMP Study).  There is no publicly documented proof, or explanation of the moderate to large growth the 2019 EFMP predicts in the KES district.
As of the June 2019 EFMP report, there are 136 undeveloped lot in UES boundary and 13 in KES boundary. Future enrollment numbers per development (per Cropper GIS) are 6 elementary students in the KES boundary and 251 elementary students in the UES boundary.  This development will lead to significant growth expected within the UES boundary and adding PB29 and PB167 to the UES boundary will only exacerbate the problem and lead to future redistricting sooner.  PB29 and PB167 currently have 126 elementary school students within them.  This is a significant burden on the UES boundary.  Thus, moving students in PB29 (currently 96 students) from Kemptown Elementary is irresponsible in looking forward at future growth and school capacity needs.
Moving 2 planning blocks (PB29 and PB167) to UES adds to an already overcrowded school unnecessarily. This leads to the likelihood of large-scale redistricting in the near future as well as highly overcrowded schools.  However, leaving the KES boundary the way it is during the 2018-2019 academic year allows for the much-needed additional growth within the UES boundary, as shown in the projected enrollment data over the course of the next ten years.
Not moving PB29 and PB167 allows growth for UES without impacting capacity rates at KES.  The room these students would occupy would be better used for planned growth patterns, rather than the high probability they would be moved back and forth in the near future.  This would greatly impact our children (both the children at KES and UES) by increasing the number of times neighborhoods are redistricted, resulting in instability in neighborhoods and continued disruption of assigned feeder patterns.  Not only does moving children out of the current KES boundary do a great disservice to our children, but it would serve to exacerbate the problems this redistricting study is working so hard to resolve.
Proposed alternative (Option B+):  Keep the Kemptown Elementary School Boundary as it is currently.
This option would allow for a Urbana Elementary School to grow, as the Urbana community grows.  It would keep Twin Ridge Elementary from becoming further overcrowded.  Additionally, this proposal does not skeletonize Kemptown Elementary School.There is no need to move PB29 and PB167 from Kemptown ES.  Kemptown is not overcrowded, nor is it expanding.  Urbana ES will need to capacity as the areas closer by are developed.
Also, Option A causes a double split feeder pattern for PB29 and PB167, which is very detrimental to the
students.oOption A creates a double split feeder pattern for only 2 neighborhoods (Windsor Knolls and Loch Haven)There is no need to move any areas out of Kemptown ES.  Kemptown is not overcrowded and is not
projected to be overcrowded.Option A shows blind favoritism to the villages of Urbana and should not be adopted at the expense of
Kemptown Elementary.
