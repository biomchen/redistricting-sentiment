this community.Keeps everyone together!I like that it maximizes walkers and limits addition to school buses.It keeps Urbana togetherKeeps Urbana togetherPerfectFeel comfortable with the boundaries, as long as future enrollment has been considered for the large portion of Stone Barn still under construction.

Less impact on students. More walkers. CES and Sugarloaf are
used for VOU kids while surrounding areas go to UES.I like that option A provides capacity relief for many elementary schools while having less impact on students than Option B. I also like that it allows for more walkers. Finally I like that it divides residents of
VOUs between CES and Sugarloaf ES while having the areas surrounding VOU go to UES.
