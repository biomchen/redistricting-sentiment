It's fine.See above as they are the sameSame place as we are already- very close to neighborhoodGreen Valley does make the most sense for our neighborhood based on proximity. However, I do believe it needs some renovations. We may also have to consider if that school will be able to hold the number of
children that will be sent there from the Landsdale community in the coming years.nanKeeps us in the same elementary schoolNo opinionNo changeproximity, no change to current schoolnot applicable to my middle schoolerI like it and agree with itThe kids still go to Green ValleyI like that GVES and Centerville will have less kids and draw from a smaller areaIt reduces the GVES attendanceReduces overcrowding-even though just a few percentage points it's still better for the kidsIt is fine as it maintains the ES for which we are currently zoned.That my children would attend Urbana ES.ES school remains Green Valley for our communitymore peers will move to middle school with my kidsNothing, it singles out Landsdale and force our kids to go to a HS that is farther away.FineNothing is changing so not sure what to say about thisNo opinionIt's fine. Same.My kids would stay at Green Valley.Stays the same - GoodGood teachersNothing - It does not address overcrowding at Green ValleyGood teachersKeeps Lansdale neighborhood together and at closest schoolnanNothing.  This is not a feasible option that helps or prepares to relieve future overcrowding at Green Valley
ES .Im good with that optionI prefer that Windsor Knolls neighborhood remain in KES area.NothingnanNothing.  GVES is overcrowded and run down.  Fix it.reduces overcrowding for the futureokI like the location of option Bnot acceptableClose to neighborhoodI like the fact that more students are moved out of the GVES zone to help a little bit with terrible
overcrowding GVES is facing.Good that it is Green Valley ElemNot happyNothing.  Green Valley is an unsatisfactory school.nanI do not like this option. It isolates part of my neighborhood and puts us at Twin Ridge for elementary school. Then we are districted to Windsor Knolls for middle school. It makes sense to keep the kids at Green
Valley since it's a feeder elementary school to Windsor Knolls.Lower enrollment projection for Green ValleyOption B is my preferred choice
