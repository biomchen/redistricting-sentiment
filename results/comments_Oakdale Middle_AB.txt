Neighborhoods should not be split down the middle for redistricting.I do not think option B is feasibly possible.  It will divide a few streets in the community to a different middle school making carpools, community and school spirit difficult and produces bus issues.  Option A allows the entire community to stay together and seems the more prudent and feasible option.  Option B has
too many issues and complications arising from only a few streets in the neighborhood to be redistricted.It is absurd to isolate one small (very small) neighborhood from their community.  If you are going to split
please consider a larger division line.I don't like that the Meadows development is going to be split into to schools- this will be tough on our kids.It is ridiculous to separate ONLY the Meadows area students from ALL the other LL students!As a family we are completely opposed to plan B. So far as I will consider moving if the plan is the final
plan.It is important to keep the Meadows and Balmoral within the Oakdale HS feeder.I prefer Option A but see the value in both.These options make sense as to not break up friends and having to move from one school to the other and
then back again.A is better than BAgain, option B please! Far outweighs option a's benefitsThe redistricted area in the Eastern part of the county is not a community in the same sense that Eaglehead is.  Redistricting more rural areas is easier on families and friendships that in densely populated
communities where we rely on car-pooling and kids being on the same schedule.This option helps keep kids in the Linganore community together in the most consistent way possible.  By allowing Meadows/Balmoral to stay in the same Oakdale pattern you are giving us the chance to maintain both student relationships AND parent relationships.  I rely heavily on the other parents for updates, information, and general details about if my kid is okay.  Even the walking trails in the Balmoral and Meadows areas connect with the rest of the community.  These relationships  make our schools strong and our students perform better (which honestly, is great for the county).  It will be a detriment for the neighborhood and the school district if that advantage is taken away.  (I do not live in Balmoral/Meadows, I live in Pinehurst and this is still really important to me.  I like knowing the kids I see at the pool and at the
park - I would hate to not have that anymore).Not sure why Windsor Knolls is so s p r e a d  o u t. Seems like you could combine the shift from Windsor Knolls MS to New Market MS up north (from Option A) with the shift from Urbana MS to Windsor Knolls MS down south (from Option B), essentially shifting the whole attendance area of Windsor Knolls south by a bit. You end up splitting the Twin Ridge Elementary feeder pattern, but that was going to happen with
Option A anyway.NoKeep optionA and ditch option B!!!!Prefer Option ASplitting the lake Linganore villages is unacceptable. This was discussed in round one and our voices were loud and clear that we are ONE lake Linganore.  Splitting off just two villages is a detriment to our sense of
community.AMeadows is the farthest neighborhood from NMMS.. why not include one closer? Pinehurst? Summerfield?
Option A would be best.  Keeps the neighborhoods together.Vote for Option AOption B takes a small chunk of our community and sends them to a different schoolNoYou are tearing apart a community. The developers and the county are wrecking the community.This option spilts lake Linganore upIn Option B, it seems like the pocket pulled out of Oakdale to go to New Market is a very small portion of our neighborhood. These kids will be more isolated from old friends as well as new friends since they don't really connect by quick access to the other areas that go to this school.
Option B splits up the kids at the new elementary school and sends them to 2 different middle and high schools.
In Option B, would it be possible to keep the existing houses/area from the Meadows/Balmoral in Lake Linganore at Oakdale and all the new building around the new elementary school would be the cut off to New Market Middle? Obviously, there are not current occupants living in that area and home owners
would buy with the understanding of the boundary lines.We moved here with the knowledge that our child would attend Oakdale schools, and we want our child to
attend with the other students in our chosen communityPrefer aIt's odd to me that 2 small neighborhoods (Meadows and Balmoral) would be separated from the rest of LLA. The new neighborhoods won't be affected so it makes sense to start them now, but leave the kids and
community as it is. Option B is ridiculous when you look at it on the map.I don't understand why a community would be split so drastically.  It could cause a rift since Linganore and
Oakdale are rivals.nanYes. Keep Lake Linganore together.  Do the right thing and keep Lake Linganore together.In option B, the meadows and balmoral neighborhoods from lake Linganore are separated from the rest of the community that the children have grown up in. It changes the schools the children are currently in and will separate friends and neighbors and at tough time in children's life. The meadows and  Balmoral are also very small neighborhoods and would not make a significant impact on overcrowding at Oakdale middle
and high school.B is ridiculous to carve out the meadows and balmoral.In Option B you divide the Lake Linganore community, sending a small portion  (the Meadows and Balmoral) to a different middle and high school than the rest of the community. I think it is unfair to separate such a small group from their peers. These kids have grown up sharing the same pools, beaches, sports teams and boy/girl scout groups. My daughter will graduate from Oakdale Middle School when this goes into effect and then have to go to Linganore High School. This is a lot of burden on a few students to
leave 90% of their peers to go to a different high school. You mentioned that you would divide schools as close to 50/50 as you could.NoI prefer Option A because it does not break off one of the longest existing villages from the Lake Linganore Community.  As a Meadows resident for 19 years, my children have grown up with and formed relationships with other children in the Lake Linganore community including Pinehurst, Aspen, and Coldstream.  The uptick of growth and additions to Lake Linganore and surrounding communities makes Meadows residents feel like we are being "pushed out" , especially with this surprise Option B.   Why can't the "new growth" /"new builds" take the impact of being redistricted to NMMS since the boundaries could be set and established before the houses are built?
I do have concern about the facility at NMMS.  The open classrooms are outdated.  Are they considered secure?  If my child attends OMS for one year and then NMMS the next year, there is an obvious discrepency in the physical facilities. Will this, in addition to my child's second transition to another middle
school,  affect morale?Option B is a non-starter.  It removes the Meadows and Balmoral kids from any schooltime social interaction
with literally every other village in Lake Linganore.Why do you insist on splitting the two villages in Lake Linganore community from the others?Keep us in Oakdale MiddleOption A: Would like to see our kids continue in the same schools as their friends that they play sports with,
spend summers with and build relationships with.Option A feels like punishment - why is this small group of Meadows students the group that is excluded?NoneIt is logical to feed future developments Hamptons West and East into New Market Middle and Linganore HS pattern. Construction is beginning and putting new developments into the LHS feeder will not cause community disruption like taking established neighborhoods out of their current feeder. Option B will
disrupt community ties in Lake Linganore.It makes no sense why you've heard how impt it is to keep the LL community together and didn't include
one tiny section of the Meadows/BalmoralI am in favor of option A, opposed to option B.  I am a teacher in the LHS feeder pattern and know how good of a feeder pattern it is.  However, I feel option B has significant issues with moving a contingent of  the community to an entirely different system.  I do see the effects of option B with those living within the LHS/UHS feeder pattern, but those changes seem much more feasible as these students already have connections to LHS/UHS with their feeder systems currently merged.  Is seems a far more prudent decision to keep all of our community together as option A presents, as it is and has been for years, rather than take a disproportionate amount of our community and send it to a different school, allowing for two feeder systems of busses within the same community, and a significant amount of change for those students
currently in the middle school.The map seems not to take the road network into account.  For example, Gas House Pike will be receiving  far more traffic if the northern Lake Linganore neighborhoods are redistricted to feed Linganore HS.  Like many country roads in this county, it's not suited for large amounts of traffic, and it presents a real hazard in
winter.no, i would prefer option aBuying a house in my neighborhood and building friendships was a key role in my decision. I certainly
hope that you take this into consideration and go with option A.No.These look much better than original options which had smaller neighborhoods being bounced around from
established feeder patterns.overall goodWill keep LLA community children in the same schools as their neighborhood friends! Better sense of
community. Please don't split these kids up.NaI prefer options that keep neighborhoods next to each other going to the same schoolNOI would like to say that one of the tings I love about our Lake Linganore Community is that it is a diverse group in and of themselves. We have many layers of income in our neighborhood old condos and small homes to very large new houses. A large amount of rentals to ownership. People move inside the community and rarely leave unless relocating. I think that separating old communities from the new ones is
tricky. One of our commonalities is the High School Pride. It would be a shame to loose that.N/A.Like A, but not B. B pulls away from rest of LLA communityIt is unfair to move The Meadows to New Market Middle and Linganore High School when other
neighborhoods are closer in Draft B.PB 154, 157, and 159 are established, completed Lake Linganore villages (Meadows and Balmoral villages) surrounding the lake in the Oakdale feeder. In option A, these would remain with all the other current villages in the community (excluding West Winds-PB146, which is currently in the Linganore feeder and has their own board). Option A is great from the perspective of the Lake Linganore neighborhood, which is very close knit and intertwined. In Option B, these villages (PB154, 157, 159) are now the only core Lake Linganore Villages in the NMMS/Linganore feeder. It seems a preferable split in option B would be to have PB 154, 157, and 159 remain with the rest of the current, already built Lake Linganore villages and have PB158, which will gain close to 900 homes when new development is started/complete, and PB146 (West Winds already in Linganore feeder) feed into NMMS and LHS. Although this will initially skew the feeder split in option B from the East County ES to OMS and NMMS, the development in PB 158 will even this out
over time.As far as I can see, Middle School Option A keeps most of the students with the same feeder pattern.
Middle School Option B has one small section of Lake Linganore going to different schools and seems unfair to those students.  I have a child who has difficulty making friends; she managed to make one good friend this year in middle school who (of course) may now go to another school if Option B is picked.  It's small
things like that that make a difference to many people.nanUnder the original three options at the March meeting all of Lake Linganore remained at OHS. We were  told that no new options would be created and that Lake Linganore would remain within the OHS feeder. Under the revised Option B the small villages of Balmoral and Meadows are pulled into the LHS feeder. We were told that it was to create an even split at the East County elementary school level as students move into middle school. Though it creates a near term even split, there is much growth to be had within the Hamptons West community to eventually balance out an uneven split if the Meadows and Balmoral remained within the OHS feeder. And never mind projections numbers could be wrong (as they have been in the past) and create an uneven split in the out years. Additional, in terms of priorities, an "even school split" is not listed in Policy 200.2 as criteria to consider but Impact on Communities, Proximity to School,  and Established Feeder Patterns is listed as criteria for the Board. And Impact on Communities was a top priority chosen by families during the Jan meeting presentation. Moving a small number of students (roughly 100 at the elem, middle, and high school levels) into a new high school feeder pattern simply to satisfy a 50/50 elementary to middle school split seems like it goes against the following criteria: Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. It pulls a very small portion of students from the greater Lake Linganore community, a community that is very connected both physically (via trails) and socially,  and isolates these students. Never mind these very students were redistricted from LHS to OHS just 8 years ago; and now you are suggesting to redistrict them back again. That impacts the community negatively and also has a profound affect on student welfare which was another top priority voted on by the parents. In regards to over crowding, moving the Meadows and Balmoral Villages back into the OHS feeder under Option B does not impact capacity numbers, in fact it helps to balance them out across schools. In terms of proximity to schools, also a top priority voted on my parents, there are other Planning Blocks that are closer to NMMS than Balmoral and the Meadows. I do not see any benefit to moving the Balmoral and Meadows Villages into the NMMS/LHS feeder pattern; I see more disadvantages and challenges for this small group of students in terms of being isolated from their greater community. Though Option B creates a better utilization rates across schools, I would recommend moving Balmoral and the Meadows back to the OHS
feeder.I do not find option B feasible for several reasons including two feeder pattern busses in the community, sectioning  a portion of a large community to a different feeder pattern and other boundaries that seem to be mitigating factor on our community being redistricted already is involved in a divided pattern with LHS/UHS and WKMS, which feeds into both.  Option A has our community and it's established
relationships continuing a cohesive  positive school environment.  My opinion has nothing to do with the quality of NMMS.  I think it is a great school with a great student and staff population.NoGreat layouts. Either will work well.I would prefer if we can take the best of both options A and B and still keep the majority of Lake Linganore students in Oakdale feeder. Rather than take Meadows and Balmoral villages (planning blocks 154, 157 and
159) out of Oakdale and sent to Linganore feeder, keep those villages in Oakdale feeder and start Hampton
East and West in Linganore feeder.Option A is the right answer for my family lifenanUnsureUnsureI think a combo of A and B would be best. Maintain the Oakdale feeder as is in Lake Linganore. Instead of removing Meadows and Balmoral villages (planning blocks 154, 157, 159) as option B suggests, keep those villages in Oakdale feeder as it affects less than 100 students. It keeps the community aspect of Lake Linganore that most residents want to preserve. Hamptons East and West should be part of Linganore
feeder from the beginning.If the new east county elementary school will not be feeding into one middle school, I would like the school to be split 50/50 for middle school. Ideally, it would be nice if the entire elementary school fed into the same
middle school.Please consider in whatever option you choose to keep the Meadows and Balmoral with the rest of their
community.Pinehurst and Summerfield much loser to NMMSInteresting split and change for Lake Linganore residents in Option B... not sure if it's the best solution.nanThe Meadows should not be split from the rest of Lake Linganore. I've heard about an option that would move the meadows back but not the new Hamptons. Our children have already formed tight bonds with all
the areas of LL and should not be split upPLEASE consider with either option that you keep the established communities of Lake Linganore together (Balmoral / Meadows).  New development can be included with the West Winds and LHS feeders but
Balmoral / Meadows should stay with what they've known for the benefit of the less than 100 kidsBoth drafts are acceptable to me as they both include our PB moving directly from OES to OMS. This is the
closest middle school to our pb/neighborhoodI think the best option relies upon a combo of A and B. Keep planning blocks 154, 157 and 159 in Oakdale feeder. Hamptons East and West should join Linganore feeder with WestWinds. The # of affected students in the aforementioned planning blocks is under 100. Please don't remove them from the schools which almost the entire rest of our community attend. Lake Linganore is an extremely tight-knit, active neighborhood. These kids see their school friends constantly at neighborhood events and activities. Please don't remove them and put them in a feeder with students who's houses they can't walk or ride their bikes
to like they do now.Option A is a better option because it impacts the least amount of children and on top of that the rates of utilization are far more balanced than in option B. In option B the Lake Linganore community would be impacted twice first at the elementary level and the neighborhoods of the meadows and balmoral will be impacted again at the middle school level splitting to tiny neighborhoods and the kids that belong there greatly. Children in these community have tons of activities related to the schools, the schools is like the meeting ground for their social community lives, they have after school programs, belong to the sport team at the high school , they already have an identity tied to the schools , and they already are going through a split at the elementary level and then they will be split again at the middle school level while deer crossing  is not going to be splitting. This seems to be really unfair to them. Meadows and Balmoral (planning blocks 154,157,159)are two of the most established and older neighborhoods in this area. That is why kids are going to be impacted greatly at every level. My kids have been in this school from the start of their school years and they will be crushed if they have to move.
I want to add that the rate of utilization at the middle school level is for Oakdale Middle in Option A 73% and in Option B 64%. Why would they move these neighborhoods if that rate of utilization is low and not balanced with the higher rate of utilization in the other middle schools in the study . Their projections might not be accurate, our neighborhoods are growing older. The new neighborhoods are being prioritize since the new houses being built in Lake Linganore are being kept in the oakdale feeder, and these new neighborhoods don't have the strong roots and ties the older ones have.  Are we catering to the developer   by excluding the older neighborhood from their community schools and keeping the newer more affluent and proposed new developments?.
Impact on the community was high on the priority list and this option does not seem to be reflecting this since we are splitting a small neighborhood from the community in Lake Linganore for a small benefit in numbers and under utilizing the middle school(oakdale) waiting for the developer to build more houses so we fill the numbers. You don't split a community unless is completely necessary and this does not reflect
that. We are small we are not the size of urbana.Option A is the best optionI do not like how Middle School Option B separates Planning Blocks 154, 157 and 159 from the rest of the
Lake Linganore community.During the June meeting, we learned that under Option B the Lake Linganore Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows would be redistricted into the LHS feeder. We were told by Mr. Cropper during the June meeting, that we were moved into the LHS feeder simply to balance an elementary to middle school split and not to alleviate crowding at the middle school or high school level.It excludes just the neighborhood that I currently live in from the rest of the linganore communityNo thank you.We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually betterOption A is our hope and all I can say is it is as simple as keeping the kids in the Lake Linganore Community together.  Option B is not a good choice for our Meadows neighborhood because the kids will
be separated from their neighbors in Lake Linganore.Option A makes no sense.   Pinehurst and summerfield are so much closer  to NMMS.Why send the furthest neighborhood to New Market middle?  Pinehurst and Summerfield are so much closer.   Wouldn't middle schools be relieved by sending Woodridge to TJMS? How about the neighborhoods across 144 from Spring Ridge. Those neighborhoods are closer to TJ middle/high school
than Spring ridge.NoWe are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually betternanI would prefer that all neighborhoods with access to gas house pike be switched to NMMS and Linganore High School particularly my community of Woodridge in lake Linganore to decrease driving distance and
traffic navigation for young drivers in the future.I felt that the option A was the better choice.  It really take the neighborhoods in account and keeps
neighbors together better.Keep Lake Linganore as one community. Do NOT separate out if the impact on schools is inconsequential.I much prefer option A over option BIn both option A and option B our specific village (Woodridge) of lake linganore is going to the Oakdale MS. I am VERY pleased BOTH of these options for my children for several reasons.  The community will remain closely connected with a large bulk of the other villages in Lake Linganore as they both keep a steady feeder
pattern with multiple villages.I strongly feel DRAFT Option A is a better option for the Lake Linganore community. DRAFT B separates our connected community. I feel a better option would be to place the Meadows and Balmoral back into the OMS/OHS feeder pattern. Please creat a DRAFT B where the Meadows and Balmoral continue in the
OMS/OHS feeder pattern.We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows, planning blocks 154,157,159 be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middleOption A keeps or community together while option B will break out some families in the Meadows. It would be nice if those students could stay in the Oakdale feeder program and make new developments start
in the NMES, LMS and LHS.Adding Balmoral/Meadows villages back to Oakdale MS in option B would not negatively impact capacity
and enhance physical and social interactions of my children with peers in the lake linganore communityNoI don't understand why the Lake Linganore Villages of Balmoral and Meadows were moved to the NMMS/LHS feeder under Option B. It does not seem necessary for capacity reasons as the projected capacity rate will actually be higher at LHS under this option then it would be at OHS in 2028. And this option was not part of any of the original options presented to the community; in fact I know some in the neighborhood are still unaware that a new option was created. Furthermore it goes against the preferred criteria of Established Feeders and Impact on Communities. Seems odd to move this small group of students to a new middle/high school feeder. It would isolate them from the greater Lake Linganore community. If this option is chosen, I would hope the BOE would consider grandfathering in more than just high school seniors as it is essentially removing 20-30 students at each grade level and placing them in a new school.
That seems unfair socially. Current per grade enrollment is roughly 250 students at the middle school level and 400 at the high school level. Why move such a small number of students? It's doesn't achieve the goal of reducing capacity at the high school level. I don't understand what it achieves. And never mind we were
just redistricted to OHS only 8 years ago. Why ping pong us back again?NoKeeping parts of Lake Linganore that currently go to OMS and OHS, still going to OMS and OHS is a
priority for that communityThis is in regard to Option B:  the Lake Linganore Village of Woodridge had the March Option B (redistricted to GTJMS) removed from consideration as a result of their vocal petition despite the low utilization rate of GTJMS under both of the current options. Clearly indicating that even splits and capacity utilization are a lower priority compared to Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. My comments re Option B does not create an over capacity situation (in either option A or B), therefore, we should be afforded the same consideration in order to remain at OMS and OHS.  Also, Moving us out of the OHS feeder goes against the criteria of maintaining existing feeders and would negatively impact our
neighborhood and community by socially isolating a small number of students from their peers in the larger community.With Option A I am concerned that Oakdale Middle will become overcrowded  in a few years. I prefer
Option B.Prefer that TJ Middle not be brought back as an optionIt makes absolutely no sense to bus Spring Ridge kids to TJMSI like Option A the best.I would like my kids to stay within same feeder pattern and at schools that are closest to our home.Not alleviating the overcrowding issues at OMS.  Why is Talon Ridge going to OMS and not TJMS????????? It's a new community and the school is already overcrowded.  New developments that are not close to a
school should not be able to go to an already overcrowded school.I prefer A but I like them both.Option B splits off portions of Linganore that doesn't make sense for neighborhood continuity.option B divides the linganore communityNothing. I am
In the landsdale community and I am not happy bout the change. I would like the schooling to stay as is.We are requesting that the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows be moved back into the OHS feeder under Option B as it does not create a situation of overcapacity at the middle school level and actually better balances â€œout yearâ€ù overcapacity rates between LHS and OHS under this option. Reasons why:
- Capacity and School Utilization Numbers:
o Balmoral and the Meadows have an average of 100 students at each school level. That is a very small amount of students to move from the greater Lake Linganore community. Lake Linganore is a well connected community both physically and socially through trails that connect our neighborhood and community events. We feel that the small amount of students pulled into the LHS feeder would isolate these students socially from the greater community.
o Under Option B, moving Balmoral and the Meadows to the LHS feeder has little impact on capacity numbers at all school levels (less than 1 percent). In fact, moving us back to the OMS/OHS feeder under Option B would create a more balanced out year utilization rate at both the middle and high school levels.
- Redistricting Criteria:
o Per Policy 200.2, the Board set criteria for redistricting that is intended to guide the final decision. During the January voting, community members choose their top three criteria as priorities for consideration. Two of those criteria were Impact on Neighborhoods and Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. Moving us out of the OHS feeder goes against the criteria of maintaining existing feeders and would negatively impact our neighborhood and community by socially isolating a small number of students from their peers in the larger community.
o Our neighborhood was redistricted from LHS into OHS just 8 years ago. It seems due to our location, we could be in a situation of continually flip flopping between feeders as additional schools are built. The Board's criteria also includes keeping redistricting to a minimum.
- Split Feeders:
o It was clear from the March survey that parents prefer to avoid split feeders. Option B creates a split feeder at the elementary level. Additionally, a desire to have an even split moving from one school level to the next is not part of the overall redistricting criteria set forth by the Board and should not take priority over other factors when making a decision to alter an existing feeder pattern.
o Moving us into the NMMS/LHS feeder simply to achieve a 50/50 elementary to middle school split in the near term is not a sound reason to make a drastic change for these students. Hamptons West has yet to be built and could easily provide a better split balance as the homes are developed. As projection numbers are not always correct, trying to achieve a short term balance may result in a long-term imbalance as projection numbers have been incorrect in the past.
o Lastly, the Lake Linganore Village of Woodridge had the March Option B (redistricted to GTJMS) removed from consideration as a result of their vocal petition despite the low utilization rate of GTJMS under both of the current options. Clearly indicating that even splits and capacity utilization are a lower priority compared to Impact on Communities and Established Feeder Patterns. As our recommendation does not create an over capacity situation in either option, we should be afforded the same consideration in
order to remain at OMS and OHS.I do not think Blue Heron ES should be split up for middle school at all. There should be consistent feeder
patterns for these students.I vote BWe are pleased that our planning block 63 is now staying in the Oakdale feeder for both optionsNoThe meadows village should stay together with their community neighbors throughout school and not be
separated in middle and high schoolOption B causes a huge divide to our community. The amount of students at the MS level in the Balmoral/Meadows community is less than 1%. Moving them does not relieve overcrowding. It also doesn't help demographically. It's one of the older communities in LL so it adds no financial value to Linganore
Feeder Pattern.Same comment as for the elementary school options. "Even splits" is not a criterion for consideration.NoNot at this time since my kids aren't school aged yet but one of the main reasons we recently moved into the
neighborhood was for the Oakdale schools.My response to each option is the same: It is important to keep kids in the same feeder for all three levels of ES, MS, HS. Looking at the maps, I am thinking Option B keeps more of the kids together for all 3 levels.
Option B will also prevent overcrowding at Oakdale High and Oakdale Middle, especially as the
developments near those schools continue to grow.Option B splits 2 neighborhoods off from the entire Lake Linganore community. We all share amenities, sports teams, etc. Furthermore, it divides an elementary school in half - if all of the new school (Blue Heron)
were going to NMES, it would be a more appealing option.Moving the Villages of Balmoral and the Meadows (PB 154/157/159) out of the OHS feeder in Option B goes against the Board criteria of maintaining existing feeders and would negatively impact our neighborhood and community by socially isolating a small number of students from their peers in the larger community. It was clear from the March survey that parents prefer to avoid split feeders. Option B creates a split feeder at the elementary level. Additionally, a desire to have an even split moving from one school  level to the next is not part of the overall redistricting criteria set forth by the Board and should not take
priority over other factors.Breaking up the Meadows and Balmoral into the LHS feeder seems short sighted.NothingPolicy 200.2 lists impact on neighborhoods and communities as a guiding factor. By moving only the villages of Meadows and Balmoral in option B to a new middle and high school, those villages and the larger Lake Linganore community will be adversely impacted. The villages that border Boyers Mill Rd. and this side of Eaglehead Dr. are deeply connected, not only by school relationships but through community events such as our farmers markets, concerts, annual festivals, our trails, pools, beaches, and the lake.
Residents of Meadows and Balmoral walk to events and amenities.  Children bike, walk, and scooter to friend's houses between the villages on either side of Boyers Mill Rd. By separating the small number of students in planning blocks 154, 157, and 159 from their friends and classmates and sending them to new middle and high schools, you will be socially isolating them.  Those friendships will fade and children will not be able to walk or bike to the homes of new friends from New Market Middle School or Linganore HS. The new, not yet built neighborhoods of Hamptons East and West could attend NMMS and LHS without this adverse effect because those residents have not established relationships with residents of other villages through school. They will form those friendships at Blue Heron Elementary. Let our middle and high school students keep the close friendships they have formed at Deer Crossing ES by staying together at Oakdale
MS and HS.
