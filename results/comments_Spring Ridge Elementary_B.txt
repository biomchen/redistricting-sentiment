I like that the entire Spring Ridge community will be kept together at SRES.  This will strengthen
community relationships and unify studentsthat the entire neighborhood is together (Spring Ridge)Same as 1In favorThe whole neighborhood going to the same elementary school and  keeps us part of the Lou community
that the children have always been apart of.YesIt keeps our neighborhood together.Divides less communities in the East County and Kemptown ES.It keeps future enrollment down at OHS.
