Stinks. Too large a zone.No opinion. Same as before.Windsor Knolls makes the most sense for our neighborhood based on proximity.nanKeeps us in the same middle schoolNo opinionno opinionsupport this option bc it keeps WKMS for most of KESBetter split of WKMS kids into HSno changeWindsor Knolls makes sense, walking distanceThese options are the same for us either way, and I am fine with that.proximityIt keeps Urbana more unified.Option B keeps him at the same MSNothingnot applicable to my middle schoolerUpset twin ridge won't go to new market middleI like Windsor Knolls so I would be fine with staying at the school.I like that it reaches further north.It account for the foretasted projection , education welfare increasedMy kids will still be just down the roadOvercrowds Windsor Knolls at an early time; I would rather not have the middle school over capacityNothing!It is fine.NothingIt is fine as it maintains the MS for which we are currently zoned.My son will see his SS friends again.NothingMS remains Windsor Knolls for our communityNo opinion.more peers will move to middle school from elementary with my kidsI dontNothing, it singles out Landsdale and force our kids to go to a HS that is farther away.FineThe options have no impact on us.I like that some kids from the other side of 270 and the Urbana area would come to WKMS.  Again, I am a huge advocate for maximizing the number of kids at WKMS that will go to Urbana HS - because right now, the split is very skewed towards Linganore.  I am not sure I feel that the folks out on the other side of 70 (PB82) need to come to WKMS.  I feel that this is a huge commute for them and, since they will go to
Linganore HS, there is really no need to send them closer to Urbana than the Linganore feeder areas.Not affected.No opinion as neither A/B change the feeders for my area.WKMSI like that this keeps all of the students in the Twin Ridge district together and going to the same middle
school, unlike option ANothing is changing so not sure what to say about thisNot impactedN/aPut all kemptown kids together in Windsor knolls schoolSame it's finenanNo opinion.It absorbs families who are currently driving their students to WKMS from  rural UMS-districted areas - and
it keeps KES students (and their parent volunteers) together at WKMSMakes senseagain it allows the plan to work and it affects the least amount of kids in all this moving of schoolsIt keeps us at same middle school that we are currently zoned forno opinionnanIt is close to home and will keep my daughter with her friends.Stays the same - GoodNo opinionNot much.Like Urbana middle betterLike Urbana middle betterKeeps Lansdale neighborhood together and at closest schoolnanNothing, this Option impacts the greatest number of kids and unnecessarily broadens the WKMS boundary,

causing the excessive transport need of only 19 children (east of 270)It keeps the children who attended Twin Ridge together to the greatest extent.Windsor KnollsNuetralNothingAt least the Twin Ridge kids aren't split. However, NMMS makes more sense for us- some kids on the north
end have an incredibly log bus ride to WKMS.Nothing, this Option impacts the greatest number of kids and unnecessarily broadens the WKMS boundary,
causing the excessive transport need of only 19 children (east of 270)No opinionIm good about that optionNothing, this Option impacts the greatest number of kids and unnecessarily broadens the WKMS boundary, causing the excessive transport need of only 19 children (east of 270)Maintains sense of community by keeping kids in the same community (ie Windsor Knolls) together.No opinionThe established feeder pattern is maintained for TRES , GVES and KES (100 % would attend WKMS).
More even split of students going from WKMS to UHS and LHS (60/40).I think it extends some of the boundary too far to distant neighborhoods at the southern end of the county.No opinionThis option is slightly better than A, but still sends kids from Mt Airy to a school that is much further away
(WKMS) than necessary.  NMMS is a far better option.nannanIt doesn't change for usN/a no change from where we stand nowNothing, this Option impacts the greatest number of kids and unnecessarily broadens the WKMS
boundary, causing the excessive transport need of only 19 children (east of 270)Doesn't change for usNo opinionI like that it keeps the entire Kemptown community attending WKMSnanSee aboveThis option has no impact on me.Too far!reduces overcrowding for the future, spreads out more evenly the number of students at each middle schoolNo opinionI like the fact this option making school utilization more balanced.No opinionKeeps current Kemptown students moving to WKMS togetherSeems to force some kids to have to travel further than necessary.location to home, do not need to change daycareNothingEither option is favorableokI don't like either plan.  Twin Ridge students north of I-70 should be routed to New Market.It is same as before and so no commentsI like that its pulling more kids from south county (Sugarloaf Road) to WKMSMS Option B puts too many additional areas at Windsor Knolls MS!  With this plan, WKMS will be over-
crowded very soon!does not affectThis will better balance the feeder split between UHS and LHS.No change for meWe got to Windsor knollsNo opinionwon't have middle school agesNothing, this Option impacts the greatest number of kids and unnecessarily broadens the WKMS boundary,
causing the excessive transport need of only 19 children (east of 270)Meets the following criteria: keeps communities together and proximity of schools.Option B has 100% of TRES population attending Windsor Knolls Middle, maintaining the established Feeder Pattern. Since both options divide the WKMS student population into UHS and LHS, Option B is
crucial as it ensures that TRES population is not split twice at the middle school and high school levels.Same as currentFine that it is WKMSLess switchingN/A, we stay the sameIt makes no changes to our current districtNo opinionFor my street A & B would be the sameThat current KES students will attend WKMSKeeps twin ridge classes togetherI like that all of green valley goes to windsor knolls and kids are not split into different schools.The MS distribution of students is more balanced in Option B in 2028 as compared to Option A.  As in the ES Option B, this will allow a delay in redistricting which is a benefit to both the county and the community
(less stressful and more stability).No opinionnanGoodThis one allows my son to start and finish in the same middle schoolKeeps things as is for MSnanNo opinionI have no major concerns about this option.I like that all the students currently mapped to WKMS remain mapped there in this option.Bringing the students from the southwest section of the current UMS district map into the WKMS boundary
area makes sense when observing future growth patterns. Relieves crowding  at UMS.No opinionMiddle School Projections: Total Option Projections are lower under Option B. Projected Enrollment
Percentages are lower in 2020 by 1%, 2021 by 1%, 2025 by 2%, 2028 by 5%!No answerMiddle School Projections: Total Option Projections are lower under Option B.My child will go to WKMSI do not like the boundaries for most of the districts in this option at all.No opinion
